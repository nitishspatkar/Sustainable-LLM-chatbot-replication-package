However, on average, most laptops consume between 30 to 100 watts when in use:
- **Low-end laptops** (like Chromebooks or ultrabooks) typically use around **30 to 50 watts**.
- **Mid-range laptops** generally use about **50 to 70 watts**.
- **High-performance laptops** (such as gaming laptops) can consume from **70 to 100 watts or more**.
To calculate the energy usage in watt-hours (Wh) over an hour, you simply multiply the power consumption by the time in hours.
For example:
- A laptop consuming 50 watts would use:
  \[
  50 \, \text{watts} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 50 \, \text{Wh}
  \]
- A laptop consuming 80 watts would use:
  80 \, \text{watts} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 80 \, \text{Wh}
Based on these averages, you can expect a laptop to use somewhere between **30 Wh to 100 Wh** per hour depending on its specifications and usage conditions.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":52,""numberOfOutputTokens"":967,""usageInWh"":0.3253}","5131e060-3614-4e4c-b6b9-1c5a5f66fb4a","e6c6fdc37f5247779986718dd20d086e","2025-06-22T20:49:22.1581111Z","rdhqALeKrF4-AAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF4-AAAAAAAAAA==/","""010152e4-0000-1600-0000-68586c640000""","attachments/","1750625380"

2. **Cantonal and Municipal Tax**: The canton of Zurich and the city of Dübendorf have their own tax rates that can significantly impact the total effective tax rate. Cantonal and municipal taxes generally range from about 10% to 30% depending on the specific municipality and taxpayer's income level.
In practice, the total effective tax rate (including federal, cantonal, and municipal taxes) for an individual earning CHF 120,000 could range from about 20% to 30%.

The issue you are experiencing concerning the `circle-translate` not working might be due to a few reasons. Here are some potential causes and suggestions to address them:
1. **Type and Scale of `circle-translate`:** 
   - The `circle-translate` property is applied in pixels in the x and y directions. In the interpolation you provided, it seems like you are trying to interpolate values based on the zoom level. If the scale factors for the zoom levels are not appropriate or the zoom levels are misconfigured, it could cause unexpected behavior.
   - Ensure that you are interpreting pixel units correctly.

1. **Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen (DBA)**: Deutschland und die Schweiz haben ein DBA, das regelt, wie Einkommen zwischen den beiden Ländern besteuert wird, um eine doppelte Besteuerung zu vermeiden.
2. **Einkommen des Ehemanns**: Der in der Schweiz wohnhafte Ehepartner wird in der Regel in der Schweiz besteuert. Die Schweizer Besteuerung erfolgt auf das weltweite Einkommen, wenn der Wohnsitz in der Schweiz ist.

Hier ist eine klarere Erklärung der steuerlichen Situation für ein Ehepaar, bei dem der Ehemann in der Schweiz lebt und die Ehefrau in Deutschland erwerbstätig ist:
1. **Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen (DBA)**: Das DBA zwischen Deutschland und der Schweiz regelt, wie Einkommen besteuert wird, um Doppeltbesteuerungen zu vermeiden. Grundsätzlich wird das Einkommen dort besteuert, wo es erzielt wird, aber es gibt Ausnahmen und spezifische Regelungen je nach Einkunftsart.
2. **Steuerpflicht des Ehemanns in der Schweiz**: Der Ehemann gilt als in der Schweiz ansässig und wird dort auf sein weltweites Einkommen besteuert. Falls er ausschließlich in der Schweiz Einkommen erzielt, wird dieses in der Schweiz versteuert.
3. **Steuerpflicht der Ehefrau in Deutschland**: Die Ehefrau, die in Deutschland lebt und arbeitet, wird auf ihr Einkommen in Deutschland besteuert.
4. **Gemeinsame Veranlagung**: In vielen Fällen kann das Ehepaar entscheiden, getrennt oder zusammen veranlagt zu werden, abhängig von den Steuerregeln der jeweiligen Länder und ihrer individuellen Situation. Oft werden Zusammenveranlagungen vorgenommen, wenn beide Partner im gleichen Land wohnen. Wenn sie in unterschiedlichen Ländern leben und arbeiten, kann eine getrennte Veranlagung praktischer oder vorgeschrieben sein.
Für eine detaillierte und auf die persönliche Situation abgestimmte Beratung ist es ratsam, einen Steuerberater in beiden Ländern zu konsultieren, um sicherzustellen, dass die Besteuerung korrekt und optimal erfolgt. Ein solcher Berater kann auch bei der Navigation durch das zuständige DBA und andere relevante Vorschriften helfen.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":642,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1668,""usageInWh"":0.98982}","50a40c4c-534d-4559-b791-ed7f6b607fa5","a31b03cff7ce4570a611100887b0c69f","2025-06-23T07:24:44.7421364Z","rdhqALeKrF5NAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5NAAAAAAAAAA==/","""0901254c-0000-1600-0000-6859014a0000""","attachments/","1750663498"

### Explanation and Adjustments:
1. **Adjusted Translate Values:** 
   - The translate values now gradually decrease from zoom level 0 to 20, allowing for smoother transitions. The initial value [0, 50] makes the circle translate 50 pixels vertically at zoom level 0. At zoom level 12, the translation would be 25 pixels, and finally, it becomes 0 pixels at zoom level 20.
2. **Checking the Circle's Behavior:**
   - Ensure your map's maximum zoom level is sufficient to recognize translation impact since at very close zoom levels, the translations might not be distinctly noticeable.
3. **Testing:** 
   - To comprehensively test the implementation, zoom in and out on the map to see if the circles translate correctly at different zoom levels.
4. **Dependencies and Data:**
   - Make sure that the layer's data structure and feature states (`hovered`, `selected`, etc.) are correctly defined in your source data and within the Angular component logic.
By ensuring these aspects are checked and updating the translation interpolation to reasonable pixel values, the translation should function as expected.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":498,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2261,""usageInWh"":1.26777}","a15448a2-d770-4ed0-b9d8-f984a3e15cc0","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-23T08:52:39.6089169Z","rdhqALeKrF5ZAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5ZAAAAAAAAAA==/","""0a01dc20-0000-1600-0000-685915e70000""","attachments/","1750668775"

    <div class=""content-item-value"" aria-label=""Important Measurement: Power"">90,13 kW</div>
### Key Improvements:
1. **Accessibility**: 
   - Added `aria-labels` for icons to improve screen reader accessibility.
   - Used `aria-hidden=""true""` to hide decorative icons from screen readers, as they don't convey additional information.
   - Added `aria-labels` for content sections and items to clarify the intent to screen readers.
2. **Semantic Clarity and Readability**:
   - Used `<span>` to wrap `{{ node()?.name }}` to ensure text content is correctly recognized by accessibility tools and styled accordingly.
   - Ensured each conditional rendering provides context for when the values or states are not present.
3. **Code Consistency**:
   - Ensured similar elements are structured in a uniform way for maintainability.
   - Used `ng-container` consistently for conditional logic without adding unnecessary DOM elements.
By making these enhancements, the code becomes more maintainable, accessible, and easier to understand.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":349,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2821,""usageInWh"":1.52804}","483344f3-61f6-4b5c-83b1-46924400ffa2","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-23T08:54:40.2607415Z","rdhqALeKrF5cAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5cAAAAAAAAAA==/","""0a01792e-0000-1600-0000-6859166e0000""","attachments/","1750668910"

This is to protect against clickjacking attacks and unauthorized use of their content.
If you try to load a URL like ""google.com"" into an iframe, the browser will likely block this action, and you won't see the site content displayed.
If you need similar functionality, you can consider alternative approaches:
1. **Search API**: 
   - Use the Google Custom Search JSON API to integrate Google search features into your website. This allows you to use Google's search capabilities without directly embedding the page.
2. **Embedding Maps, YouTube, etc.**:
   - For specific purposes like embedding a Google Map or a YouTube video, use their respective embedding features or APIs. These services offer dedicated methods to embed content lawfully and safely.
3. **Link Instead of Embed**:
   - Consider providing a hyperlink instead of embedding. Users can open the link in a new tab to access the desired features.
Here's a way you might use a simple link in your HTML:
<a href=""https://www.google.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">
  Visit Google
</a>
This opens the link in a new tab and `rel=""noopener noreferrer""` provides security benefits by preventing access to the originating window.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":1037,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1508,""usageInWh"":0.97537}","50be5a59-ed5c-4718-8b5d-8be858b3a5ef","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-23T08:55:34.9294138Z","rdhqALeKrF5dAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5dAAAAAAAAAA==/","""0a015033-0000-1600-0000-6859169a0000""","attachments/","1750668954"

- `<a href=""https://www.google.com"">`: This is an anchor tag (`<a>`), where the `href` attribute specifies the URL to which the link will navigate. In this case, it's the URL for Google's homepage.
- `target=""_blank""`: This attribute value specifies that the link should open in a new browser tab or window. It is useful when you don't want to navigate away from your current page but still allow users to access the linked content.
- `rel=""noopener noreferrer""`: This attribute serves two purposes:
  - `noopener`: When a new tab is opened using `target=""_blank""`, `noopener` improves security by preventing the new page from being able to access the original page through the `window.opener` property. This reduces the risk of malicious pages attempting actions on the original page.
  - `noreferrer`: This further enhances privacy by not sending the HTTP referer (misspelled as ""referer"" in the HTTP specification) header to the new page. This means the new page will not know the URL of the page a user clicked the link from.
Overall, this link is designed to enhance usability and maintain security and privacy. The user experience is improved as the link opens in a new tab, letting users continue with their tasks on the current page without disruption.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":1379,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1429,""usageInWh"":0.99322}","43ee74a4-a120-4e80-8474-bfc471639a18","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-23T08:56:04.1204861Z","rdhqALeKrF5eAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5eAAAAAAAAAA==/","""0a010035-0000-1600-0000-685916aa0000""","attachments/","1750668970"

Hier sind einige Vorschläge zur Kostensenkung:
   - **Alternative:** 
     - Verwende Hähnchenschenkel oder Hähnchen-Keulen anstelle von Hähnchenbrust. Diese sind in der Regel preiswerter und saftiger.
     - Verwende mageres Hackfleisch (Rind oder Schwein) statt Rindergeschnetzeltes. 
     - Verwende Schweinefleisch statt Putenbrust.
2. **Frische Paprika und Zucchini:**
     - Verwende saisonales und lokales Gemüse, das oft günstiger ist.
     - Tiefkühlgemüse kann ebenfalls eine kostengünstigere Option sein und hat den Vorteil, dass es länger haltbar ist.
3. **Blumenkohl und Brokkoli:**
     - Nutze je nach Saison und Angebot preiswerte Gemüsesorten wie Karotten oder Kohl.
4. **Avocados:**
   - **Alternative:**
     - Verwende stattdessen preiswertere und trotzdem cremige Optionen wie Hummus oder pürierte weiße Bohnen für Cremigkeit.
5. **Kräuter und Zitronen:**
     - Verwende getrocknete Kräuter, die oftmals günstiger sind und länger halten.
     - Zitronensaftkonzentrat kann günstiger sein als frische Zitronen.
6. **Quinoa und Linsenpasta:**
     - Verwende Reis oder Hirse als preiswertere Alternative zu Quinoa.
     - Normale glutenfreie Pasta aus Reis oder Mais ist oft günstiger als Linsenpasta.
7. **Schwarze Bohnen:**
     - Trockenbohnen sind in der Regel kostengünstiger als Dosenbohnen, erfordern jedoch etwas mehr Zubereitungszeit.
### Andere Tipps zur Kostensenkung
- **Kaufe in Großpackungen:** Wenn du die Möglichkeit hast, in Großmärkten oder einem Discounter einzukaufen, sind Basislebensmittel wie Reis, Nudeln, und Bohnen oft günstiger.
- **Einkauf während Aktionen:** Achte auf wöchentliche Angebote und Rabatte, die oft in lokalen Geschäftsflyern oder online vorhanden sind.
- **Markenprodukte vs. Handelsmarken:** Oft sind Handelsmarken oder Eigenmarken der Supermärkte günstiger und qualitativ ähnlich zu bekannten Markenprodukten.

### Explanation:
- **HTML/Template Code**: The map is initialized within an Angular component. It uses an `<ng-container>` to iterate through the `markers` array to display each marker on the map.
- **TypeScript/Component Code**: 
  - The `MapComponent` class:
    - Implements `OnInit` to generate markers after the component is initialized.
    - The `markers` array stores objects that each have `lngLat` for coordinates and a `message`.
  - `ngOnInit()` method:
    - Populates the `markers` array with 1000 random markers.
    - Each marker gets a random longitude between -180 and 180, and a latitude between -90 and 90.
    - Each marker also has a message which indicates its number.
  - `randomInRange()` method:
    - Returns a random number within a specified range.
When this code runs in an Angular environment with Mapbox GL, it will display 1000 clickable markers on a global map. Adjust the `max` and `min` values in `randomInRange()` to focus on specific regions if needed.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":62,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2472,""usageInWh"":1.30126}","a49cf335-0cc3-4f9f-b097-8136ac9a2922","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-23T09:14:38.7035273Z","rdhqALeKrF5mAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5mAAAAAAAAAA==/","""0a0114a9-0000-1600-0000-68591b240000""","attachments/","1750670116"

However, if you're thinking about looping to create multiple elements (like markers) within a template, you'd typically use `*ngFor`, which is Angular's built-in directive for iterating over a collection.
However, if you're referring to using a preprocessor like SCSS for styling purposes where `@for` is relevant, that concept doesn’t directly apply to generating Angular components or HTML elements. But I can guide you on how you might mimic such functionality using `*ngFor` in Angular.
Here's how you might set up your Angular component and template to effectively loop and create the markers:
### Using *ngFor in Angular (With Example)
<!-- map.component.html -->
// map.component.ts
    this.generateMarkers(1000);
  generateMarkers(count: number) {
    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
1. **Template (`map.component.html`)**:
   - Utilizes `*ngFor` to iterate over the `markers` array and create a `mgl-marker` for each entry.
2. **Component (`map.component.ts`)**:
   - **`markers`**: An array that holds data for each marker: coordinates and a message.
   - **`ngOnInit()`**: Calls `generateMarkers()` to populate the `markers` array.
   - **`generateMarkers(count: number)`**: Generates the specified number of markers with random longitudes and latitudes.
   - **`randomInRange(min, max)`**: Provides a random number between a given range, used here to generate random coordinates.
This setup dynamically creates 1000 markers when the component initializes. Each marker is placed randomly on the map. The interaction (`(click)=""alert(marker.message)""`) provides a simple way to demonstrate interactivity with each marker.
If by `@for` you were specifically referring to a SCSS or CSS loop, that's not applicable in this context, as styling would only handle CSS properties rather than element generation.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":688,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2962,""usageInWh"":1.65758}","1142b1c1-8e93-4aa3-8c73-8aaf7d7dd0d8","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-23T09:16:04.9176973Z","rdhqALeKrF5nAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5nAAAAAAAAAA==/","""0a010bb2-0000-1600-0000-68591b7a0000""","attachments/","1750670202"

Let's define an approximate bounding box for Baden, Switzerland, and generate random coordinates within this box.
Baden is a small city, so the bounding box will be quite narrow, ensuring all points fall within or very close to the city.
Here's how you can achieve this in an Angular component:
### Steps:
1. Define the approximate bounds for Baden.
2. Generate random coordinates within these bounds.
      // Define the approximate bounding box for Baden, Switzerland
      const minLng = 8.2758;
      const maxLng = 8.3258;
      const minLat = 47.4634;
      const maxLat = 47.5034;
      const lng = this.randomInRange(minLng, maxLng);
      const lat = this.randomInRange(minLat, maxLat);
- **Bounding Box**:
  - **Longitude Range**: Approximately from `8.2758` to `8.3258`
  - **Latitude Range**: Approximately from `47.4634` to `47.5034`
  - These ranges are approximate and should be verified for your specific use case, as they're intended to cover a small urban area.
- **`generateMarkers()` function**:
  - Generates 1000 markers using random coordinates constrained to the defined bounding box.
  - Uses `randomInRange()` to generate a random longitude and latitude within the specified bounds.
  - Assigns each marker a unique message.

This class provides a way to open files and read from them. Here is a basic example of how you can use it to read data from a file given its path:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string filePath = ""yourfile.txt""; // Replace with the path to your file
        // Check if the file exists at the given path
        if (!File.Exists(filePath))
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""File does not exist."");
            return;
        }
        // Open the file in a read-only stream
        using (FileStream fileStream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read))
            using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(fileStream))
            {
                string content;
                while ((content = reader.ReadLine()) != null)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(content); // Outputting file content line by line
                }
            }
        // Alternatively, you can directly read all contents at once if the file isn't too large:
        // string content = File.ReadAllText(filePath);
        // Console.WriteLine(content);
- **File.Exists(filePath)**: This check ensures that the file exists before attempting to open it.
- **FileStream**: This is used to open a stream to the file. The `FileMode.Open` specifies that the file should be opened, and `FileAccess.Read` specifies that the stream is read-only.
- **StreamReader**: This is used to read text from the file stream. It provides convenient methods for reading data, such as `ReadLine()`, which reads the file line by line.
- **Using Statement**: Both `FileStream` and `StreamReader` are wrapped in `using` statements to ensure that they are disposed of correctly after use, freeing any resources.
This example reads a file line by line and outputs its content to the console. If you need to handle large files or read binary data, adjusting the reading methods and buffer sizes might be necessary.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":8,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2123,""usageInWh"":1.11409}","45872397-816b-436d-bf0a-851ad47a0bb9","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-23T09:47:06.3355652Z","rdhqALeKrF5pAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5pAAAAAAAAAA==/","""0b017067-0000-1600-0000-685922a50000""","attachments/","1750672037"

cleanup","2","gpt-4o","10","true","2025-06-23T11:08:27.041741Z","To clean up your CSS for better readability and maintainability, you can make the following changes:
1. **Standardize Units:** Ensure that all dimensions have units specified (e.g., `px` for pixels).
2. **Remove Duplicate Properties:** Remove redundant or overridden properties.
3. **Consistent Indentation:** Use consistent indentation for better readability.
4. **Comment Sections:** Use comments to separate logical sections.
Here is a cleaned-up version:

**Key Adjustments:**
- Ensured that dimensions have units (`px`).
- Consolidated duplicate properties where possible.
- Applied consistent spacing and indentation.
- Improved comments for better section separation.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":962,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3158,""usageInWh"":1.80412}","7c9dea6b-cc4f-4cef-a620-7607ecbd4c15","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-23T11:08:25.1389328Z","rdhqALeKrF5sAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5sAAAAAAAAAA==/","""0d01ef45-0000-1600-0000-685935b60000""","attachments/","1750676918"

I'll replace the CSS custom properties (`var(--property-name)`) with static color values. Here's how you could do that:
  color: #333333; /* Static dark gray color */
  color: #757575; /* Lighter gray for subtitle */
  color: #ffffff; /* Static white color */
  background: #a7a7a7; /* Static gray color */
  background: #ef942f; /* Static orange color */
  border-color: #d3d3d3; /* Light gray for divider */
  color: #686868; /* Static medium gray color */
**Explanation:**
- **Header:** Replaced header colors with standard shades of gray to maintain readability and a professional look.
- **Status, Alerts, Footer:** Ensured that all background and text colors are converted to static color values, maintaining contrast for readability.
- **Divider:** Used a light gray for the divider to subtly separate content without being too overpowering.
Feel free to adjust these static values to fit the specific aesthetics and brand guidelines of your design.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":1899,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3201,""usageInWh"":1.98534}","a85dbda3-70c0-4acd-8832-9213dc3af097","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-23T11:10:11.5272687Z","rdhqALeKrF5tAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5tAAAAAAAAAA==/","""0d019552-0000-1600-0000-685936360000""","attachments/","1750677046"

Dazu gehören die geeignete Wahl der Datentypen und die Optimierung der Struktur für Platzersparnis und Effizienz. Hier ist eine optimierte Version:
-- Optimierte Tabellenstruktur erstellen
    id SMALLINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    zeile_nummer TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    text VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    emoji CHAR(10)
**Optimierungen:**
- **Datentypen:** Die `id`-Spalte verwendet `SMALLINT UNSIGNED`, da die Anzahl der Zeilen nicht über 65535 hinausgeht, was Platz im Vergleich zu `INT` spart.
- **zeile_nummer:** Setze dies als `TINYINT UNSIGNED`, da die Zeilennummern innerhalb des Gedichts unter 256 bleiben.
- **text:** Beibehaltung von `VARCHAR(255)`, um Variabilität im Textinhalt zu ermöglichen.
- **emoji:** Verwendung von `CHAR(10)` statt `VARCHAR(10)`, da die Länge jedes Emojis ziemlich konstant ist und zwischen 4 und 8 Byte variiert. `CHAR` ist effizienter, wenn die Werte ähnliche Längen haben.
Diese Anpassungen helfen dabei, die Speicherplatznutzung zu optimieren und die Effizienz der Tabelle zu verbessern.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":2933,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2315,""usageInWh"":1.70926}","b53826e6-b022-4ed7-b62e-a2882bf73e87","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-23T13:46:48.3940994Z","rdhqALeKrF6TAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF6TAAAAAAAAAA==/","""100126ed-0000-1600-0000-68595ad60000""","attachments/","1750686422"

Review this file for me please, it's part of an MR","2","gpt-4o","10","true","2025-06-23T14:06:30.5067234Z","This code implements the `Trade` class, which represents a financial trade entity within an investment committee decision domain. Let's review various aspects of the code:
### **Structure and Design**
1. **Constructor & Factory Method**:
   - The constructor is private to enforce object creation through the `Create` static method. This is good for encapsulating the object creation logic and ensuring that trades are created with a new GUID.
   - The `Create` method simplifies object creation and ensures that all required parameters are provided.
2. **Encapsulation**:
   - Class fields `_mopos` and `_currencies` are encapsulated and accessed through read-only properties `Mopos` and `Currencies`. This provides controlled access, which is a good practice.
3. **Value Objects & Enums**:
   - The use of value objects (`InstrumentId`, `TradeWeight`, etc.) and enums (`CashAccount`) indicates an intention to model the domain more richly, which often leads to better maintainability and understanding.
### **Validation**
1. **Null and Count Checks**:
   - The methods `UpdateTradeMopos` and `UpdateTradeCurrencies` perform null and count checks on collections to ensure they are not null and have at least one item. The exception messages are clear and helpful.
2. **Usage of `InvalidOperationException`**:
   - The use of `InvalidOperationException` is appropriate here to indicate that the object is not in a valid state due to missing required inputs.
### **Potential Improvements**
1. **Collections Initialization**:
   - Instead of `[]`, use `{}` or `new HashSet<Type>()` to initialize `HashSet` fields. Using empty array `[]` for initializing sets could be misleading.
2. **Name Clarity**:
   - Ensure that the nomenclature such as ""mopo"" is clear. If ""mopo"" is a domain-specific term, its meaning should be documented somewhere in the codebase or comments.
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Consider using domain-specific exceptions instead of generic ones like `InvalidOperationException` to provide more precise error handling.
4. **Runtime Permissions**:
   - The `InternalsVisibleTo` attribute is used for granting test assembly access to internal members. Make sure this doesn't expose more of your code than necessary or violate architecture boundaries.
### **Conformance to C# Practices**
- Methods and classes follow C# naming conventions.
- The use of value objects and enums aligns with DDD (Domain-Driven Design) principles.
- The code does not have unnecessary comments, adhering to the idea that code should be self-explanatory.
### **Conclusion**
Overall, the code is well-structured and follows good practices by utilizing encapsulation, validation, and factory methods. For further improvements, pay attention to the proper initialization of collections, enhance domain-specific exception handling, and ensure clarity of domain terminology.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":685,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2876,""usageInWh"":1.61321}","9a3bacbd-5693-461a-a112-2ea82944bc24","e6c6fdc37f5247779986718dd20d086e","2025-06-23T14:06:25.1603582Z","rdhqALeKrF6UAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF6UAAAAAAAAAA==/","""1101fd60-0000-1600-0000-68595f760000""","attachments/","1750687606"

ich hoffe, es geht euch allen gut! Ich habe in letzter Zeit darüber nachgedacht, wie wir unsere Gemeinschaft weiter stärken und wachsen lassen können. Dabei kam mir die Idee, ein Konto für unsere Jungschar zu eröffnen. Dieses Konto könnte uns dabei helfen, unsere Aktivitäten besser zu planen und zu finanzieren, sei es für Ausflüge, Material oder Unterstützung für diejenigen, die es benötigen.
In der Bibel lesen wir, wie wichtig es ist, unsere Ressourcen weise zu verwalten: „Denn wo dein Schatz ist, da wird auch dein Herz sein“ (Matthäus 6,21). Mit diesem Konto könnten wir sicherstellen, dass unsere Schätze in Erlebnisse und Projekte fließen, die unsere Gemeinschaft im Glauben zusammenbringen und stärken.
Ein weiteres Beispiel aus der Bibel, das uns ermutigt, ist der Vers aus Sprüche 21,5: „Die Pläne des Fleißigen bringen Gewinn, doch wer allzu schnell alles haben will, hat nur Mangel.“ Mit gutem Management und Weitsicht wollen wir darauf hinarbeiten, dass unsere Jungschar blüht und wächst.
Lasst uns gemeinsam überlegen und beten, wie dieses Vorhaben Gestalt annehmen kann. Ich freue mich auf eure Gedanken und Ideen.
Herzliche Grüße und Gottes Segen,

Expressive interfaces have an emotional impact, fostering connection by evoking a feeling or mood through visual design and interaction. Material 3 Expressive is an evolution of the Material 3 design system. It’s a set of new features, updated components, and design tactics for creating emotionally impactful UX.\n\nWe’ve learned that makers are looking for ways to improve their user experiences by creating better hierarchy, making the interface more useful, and establishing improved, more personal styles that connect emotionally with their users.\n\nAnd to be clear — M3 Expressive isn’t a new version of the system. We’re not deprecating M3, and this isn’t “M4.”\n\nlink\nCopy link\nThe power of expressive design\nM3 Expressive is our most researched update to the design system since its launch in 2014. Extensive user research — 46 studies with more than 18,000 participants — has helped ensure that this evolution isn’t just about aesthetics, but about truly enhancing your users’ experience. Our top research takeaways include:\n\n\nExpressive designs are preferred by people of all ages.\n\nExpressive designs consistently score higher on user attributes like playfulness, energy, creativity, and friendliness.\n\nUsers are more likely to switch to products that use M3 Expressive components and techniques.\n\nExpressive designs are easier to use, with participants spotting key UI elements up to four times faster in expressive screens.\n\nLearn more about the Expressive research over on design.google.\n\nlink\nCopy link\nWhat’s in the update?\nExpressive components\nFifteen new or updated components now feature more configuration capabilities, shape options, emphasized text, and other expressive updates.\n\n\npause\nEven the smallest elements matter. Use the new and updated expressive components to create more compelling user interfaces.\nApp bars\n\nButton groups new\n\nCarousel\n\nCommon buttons\n\nExtended FAB\n\nFAB menu new\n\nFABs\n\nIcon buttons\n\nLoading indicator new\n\nNavigation bar\n\nNavigation rail\n\nProgress indicators\n\nSplit button new\n\nToolbars new\n\nExpressive styles\nMotion-physics system\nA new system using motion springs makes interactions and transitions feel more alive, fluid, and natural.\n\nSpatial springs mirror the physics of how objects actually move, making animations clear and predictable. Effects springs create seamless transitions for color and opacity changes.\n\nLearn more about motion\n\n\npause\nExpressive motion springs create more natural animation effects.\nVisually emphasized typography\nNew type styles for variable and static fonts can be used to express a range of emotional states, automatically adjust variables for readability, and support bold editorial layouts.\n\nEmphasized typography reinforces the information hierarchy and draws attention to important actions, like “begin recording,” or information, like unread messages.\n\nLearn more about typography\n\n\nThe updated type scale includes new emphasized text styles.\n\nExpanded shape library\nUse the new set of 35 shapes to add decorative detail for elements like image crops and avatars.\n\nA built-in shape-morph animation allows smooth transitions from one shape to another. This can be dynamic, or as simple as a square changing to a circle.\n\nLearn more about shape\n\n\nThe shape library has 35 iconic shapes, which can be used to add visual interest to decorative elements.\n\nVibrant color schemes\nAn expanded range of colors can be used to sharpen hierarchy and clarify key actions. Rich visual styles support personalization and dynamic colors.\n\nLearn more about color\n\n\nThe expressive color system can create a wide range of accessible palettes.\n\nExpressive tactics\nAs Google products started using the new expressive features, we quickly established a set of design tactics to help guide the viewer’s attention to the most important elements of the screen. Each of these tactics represents one axis along which you can make your components, layouts, and products more expressive. While these tactics work for us, the beauty of this update is that makers have more flexibility with M3 than ever before, so we encourage you to play around with these elements and see what works for you.\n\n1. Use a variety of shapes\nShape can be a powerful communication tool in your interface. At the base level of visual design, the shapes of components, containers, and content set the tone for a user at first glance. Combining shapes and corner radii can create visual tension or cohesion and direct users’ focus in your app. Use a combination of classic and abstract shapes to create unique silhouettes or groupings.  Use the shape library and the new corner-radii options to mix round and square shapes for tension and visual contrast.\n\n\nexclamation\nCaution\nSmaller shapes can result in essential actions looking less important.\n\ncheck\nDo\nBreak from the surrounding shape style to draw attention to a particular element.\n2. Apply rich and nuanced colors\nMaterial’s dynamic color system already offers a range of colors for primary, secondary, and tertiary elements and surfaces. Mixing these colors for key components or visual elements can help emphasize the main takeaway of a screen. Create visual hierarchy with surface tones. Use contrast between primary, secondary, and tertiary color roles to prioritize actions and simplify navigation.\n\n\nexclamation\nCaution\nWithout contrast, elements can blend together.\n\ncheck\nDo\nUse contrast to emphasize the main takeaway or element.\n3. Guide attention with typography\nUse emphasized text styles to draw attention to important UI elements, like headlines and actions. Create editorial-like moments in your app by emphasizing typography. Heavier weights, larger sizes, color, and spacing can direct attention and make key information more engaging. Using additional type styles from the Material type scale can help create appropriate hierarchy within and between blocks of content.\n\n\nExpressive typography can enhance hierarchy and add personality.\n\n4. Contain content for emphasis\nOrganize content into logical groupings or containers. Give the most important content, tasks, or actions visual prominence through ample space and the brightest surface mapping. Consider using size, spacing, rhythm, similarity, or other grouping principles to make important elements more distinct.\n\n\nexclamation\nCaution\nUngrouped information can blend together.\n\ncheck\nDo\nGroup similar content into informative groupings.\n5. Add fluid and natural motion\nMake interactions feel alive and spirited through shape morph or surface effects. Apply the expressive motion springs or custom micro animations.\n\n\npause\nExamples of expressive motion in a range of apps and devices.\n6. Leverage component flexibility\nUI should adapt to the user context. Shift components or controls depending on the environment to make completing tasks easier. Adapt content to foldable and large screens through custom tweaks or by applying canonical layouts.\n\n\nExpressive app bars, toolbars, and buttons.\n7. Combine tactics to create hero moments\nHero moments use multiple expressive tactics to break from predictable or uniformly applied design ideas. They’re meant to make a stand-alone statement or frame essential information in a fresh, editorial way. Hero moments can be a focusing mechanism. Invest your time in making the most critical interactions sing; these moments are the heart of your product!\n\nHero moments are brief, delightful, surprising, and unexpected. Stick to one or two hero moments in your product; too many moments can be overwhelming or distracting.\n\nTo identify your hero moment, ask yourself:\n\nIs this interaction emotionally impactful? Consider whether a design choice can highlight an emotional reaction or emphasize familiarity.\n\nIs this a key interaction in your product? Think about whether a detail or flow can be emphasized for clarity. Guide the user’s attention by making an important button dominant, or emphasizing key information.\n\n""]","summarize:

Material 3 Expressive is an evolution of the Material 3 design system. It’s a set of new features, updated components, and design tactics for creating emotionally impactful UX.
We’ve learned that makers are looking for ways to improve their user experiences by creating better hierarchy, making the interface more useful, and establishing improved, more personal styles that connect emotionally with their users.
And to be clear — M3 Expressive isn’t a new version of the system. We’re not deprecating M3, and this isn’t “M4.”

The power of expressive design
M3 Expressive is our most researched update to the design system since its launch in 2014. Extensive user research — 46 studies with more than 18,000 participants — has helped ensure that this evolution isn’t just about aesthetics, but about truly enhancing your users’ experience. Our top research takeaways include:
Expressive designs are preferred by people of all ages.
Expressive designs consistently score higher on user attributes like playfulness, energy, creativity, and friendliness.
Users are more likely to switch to products that use M3 Expressive components and techniques.
Expressive designs are easier to use, with participants spotting key UI elements up to four times faster in expressive screens.

Motion-physics system
A new system using motion springs makes interactions and transitions feel more alive, fluid, and natural.
Spatial springs mirror the physics of how objects actually move, making animations clear and predictable. Effects springs create seamless transitions for color and opacity changes.
Learn more about motion
Expressive motion springs create more natural animation effects.
Visually emphasized typography
New type styles for variable and static fonts can be used to express a range of emotional states, automatically adjust variables for readability, and support bold editorial layouts.
Emphasized typography reinforces the information hierarchy and draws attention to important actions, like “begin recording,” or information, like unread messages.
Learn more about typography
The updated type scale includes new emphasized text styles.
Expanded shape library
Use the new set of 35 shapes to add decorative detail for elements like image crops and avatars.
A built-in shape-morph animation allows smooth transitions from one shape to another. This can be dynamic, or as simple as a square changing to a circle.

The shape library has 35 iconic shapes, which can be used to add visual interest to decorative elements.
Vibrant color schemes
An expanded range of colors can be used to sharpen hierarchy and clarify key actions. Rich visual styles support personalization and dynamic colors.
Learn more about color
The expressive color system can create a wide range of accessible palettes.
Expressive tactics
As Google products started using the new expressive features, we quickly established a set of design tactics to help guide the viewer’s attention to the most important elements of the screen. Each of these tactics represents one axis along which you can make your components, layouts, and products more expressive. While these tactics work for us, the beauty of this update is that makers have more flexibility with M3 than ever before, so we encourage you to play around with these elements and see what works for you.
1. Use a variety of shapes
Shape can be a powerful communication tool in your interface. At the base level of visual design, the shapes of components, containers, and content set the tone for a user at first glance. Combining shapes and corner radii can create visual tension or cohesion and direct users’ focus in your app. Use a combination of classic and abstract shapes to create unique silhouettes or groupings.  Use the shape library and the new corner-radii options to mix round and square shapes for tension and visual contrast.

Caution
Smaller shapes can result in essential actions looking less important.

Break from the surrounding shape style to draw attention to a particular element.
2. Apply rich and nuanced colors
Material’s dynamic color system already offers a range of colors for primary, secondary, and tertiary elements and surfaces. Mixing these colors for key components or visual elements can help emphasize the main takeaway of a screen. Create visual hierarchy with surface tones. Use contrast between primary, secondary, and tertiary color roles to prioritize actions and simplify navigation.
Without contrast, elements can blend together.
Use contrast to emphasize the main takeaway or element.
3. Guide attention with typography
Use emphasized text styles to draw attention to important UI elements, like headlines and actions. Create editorial-like moments in your app by emphasizing typography. Heavier weights, larger sizes, color, and spacing can direct attention and make key information more engaging. Using additional type styles from the Material type scale can help create appropriate hierarchy within and between blocks of content.
Expressive typography can enhance hierarchy and add personality.
4. Contain content for emphasis
Organize content into logical groupings or containers. Give the most important content, tasks, or actions visual prominence through ample space and the brightest surface mapping. Consider using size, spacing, rhythm, similarity, or other grouping principles to make important elements more distinct.
Ungrouped information can blend together.
Group similar content into informative groupings.
5. Add fluid and natural motion
Make interactions feel alive and spirited through shape morph or surface effects. Apply the expressive motion springs or custom micro animations.
Examples of expressive motion in a range of apps and devices.
6. Leverage component flexibility
UI should adapt to the user context. Shift components or controls depending on the environment to make completing tasks easier. Adapt content to foldable and large screens through custom tweaks or by applying canonical layouts.
Expressive app bars, toolbars, and buttons.
7. Combine tactics to create hero moments
Hero moments use multiple expressive tactics to break from predictable or uniformly applied design ideas. They’re meant to make a stand-alone statement or frame essential information in a fresh, editorial way. Hero moments can be a focusing mechanism. Invest your time in making the most critical interactions sing; these moments are the heart of your product!
Hero moments are brief, delightful, surprising, and unexpected. Stick to one or two hero moments in your product; too many moments can be overwhelming or distracting.
To identify your hero moment, ask yourself:
Is this interaction emotionally impactful? Consider whether a design choice can highlight an emotional reaction or emphasize familiarity.
Is this a key interaction in your product? Think about whether a detail or flow can be emphasized for clarity. Guide the user’s attention by making an important button dominant, or emphasizing key information.

### General Suggestions:
1. Ensure your CSS variables are defined in a global scope or imported properly so they can be rendered by the user agent. For example, `var(--mat-sys-on-surface)` and other variable uses assume you have a defined value somewhere in your styling sheets.
2. Check that pixel values like widths and heights end with 'px', e.g., `width: 185` should be `width: 185px`, to avoid parsing issues.
3. Testing across different devices and browsers is critical to ensure the design remains consistent and responsive. Consider interactions and animations that might enhance UX, where relevant.

### Key Suggestions:
- **Units Consistency**: Ensure all dimensions include explicit units such as `px` to avoid potential rendering issues.
- **Font Specification**: Avoid unnecessary style overrides for fonts where possible; set a single comprehensive specification.
- **Negative Margins**: Reassess the need for negative margins to ensure they're required and check whether proper alignment might be achieved otherwise.
- **Structure**: Consider shorthand properties where applicable for cleaner code and potentially reduced file size.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":2981,""numberOfOutputTokens"":4849,""usageInWh"":3.00976}","87a4b55a-96b1-4546-9314-65fdd093b669","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-24T05:46:39.9258362Z","rdhqALeKrF6eAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF6eAAAAAAAAAA==/","""2401d758-0000-1600-0000-685a3bda0000""","attachments/","1750744026"

### Enhanced Suggestions:
1. **Font Fallbacks**: Include fallback fonts in `font-family` settings to ensure compatibility across browsers that may not support certain font types.
2. **Accessibility Check**: Double-check color contrasts to meet accessibility standards, ensuring all elements remain readable against various backgrounds.
3. **Avoid Redundancies**: Simplify font properties to consolidate definitions to reduced property bloat where possible.
4. **Negative Margins**: Re-evaluate the necessity of negative margins which can be tricky and may cause overlapping if not carefully managed.
5. **Units Consistency**: Make sure every dimension has specified units to avoid rendering issues.
Using these enhancements should result in better performance, easier maintenance, and an improved user experience across a variety of displays.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":4324,""numberOfOutputTokens"":5652,""usageInWh"":3.6476}","3e53eda2-ceee-4c4d-985d-c4ad804d115b","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-24T05:49:29.3166489Z","rdhqALeKrF6fAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF6fAAAAAAAAAA==/","""24019967-0000-1600-0000-685a3c7d0000""","attachments/","1750744189"

Here’s a general overview of the potential risks and opportunities associated with art investment:
### Opportunities:
1. **Diversification**: Investing in art can diversify your portfolio, potentially reducing risk if other asset classes (like stocks or bonds) perform poorly.
2. **Appreciation Potential**: Some artworks appreciate significantly over time, offering the potential for high returns on investment.
3. **Cultural and Aesthetic Value**: Investing in art can offer personal satisfaction through ownership of aesthetically pleasing works that can also serve as conversation pieces or status symbols.
4. **Tangible Asset**: Art is a physical asset, which can be appealing in times of economic uncertainty or inflation.
5. **Market Growth**: The global art market has been growing, with increasing interest from high-net-worth individuals, possibly driving up prices and demand.
### Risks:
1. **Valuation Challenges**: Art's value is highly subjective, making it difficult to assess and often less transparent compared to traditional financial assets. 
2. **Liquidity Concerns**: Art is not a liquid asset. It might take time to sell a piece at your desired price, especially if market demand wanes.
3. **High Entry Costs**: Quality artworks can be expensive to acquire, and there are additional costs associated with insurance, storage, and maintenance.
4. **Market Volatility**: The art market can be volatile and influenced by trends, economic conditions, and changes in taste.
5. **Fraud and Authenticity Issues**: There is a risk of fraud, with forgeries being prevalent. Proper provenance and authentication are crucial.
6. **Regulatory and Transaction Costs**: Art transactions may involve substantial fees (commissions, taxes), and buying/selling art could have legal and regulatory implications, especially when dealing internationally.
### Evaluating Partasio.com:
To specifically assess an offer from Partasio.com:
- **Due Diligence**: Investigate the platform's reputation, user reviews, and any regulatory credentials to ensure it is a legitimate and trustworthy service.
- **Understand Their Model**: Evaluate how Partasio.com operates (e.g., fractional ownership, direct sales, auctions) and the fees involved.
- **Transparency**: Ensure they provide clear information on valuations, past performance, and how they assess the authenticity and provenance of artworks.
- **Exit Strategy**: Consider how and when you can sell your investments, and at what cost or potential loss.
- **Legal Considerations**: Check for any legal obligations or restrictions associated with using the platform, especially if dealing internationally.
In summary, while art can be an alluring investment for some, it requires careful analysis and consideration of unique risks. Consulting with a financial advisor or art investment expert might be beneficial to better understand the platform and art market dynamics before committing funds.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":26,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3123,""usageInWh"":1.62715}","c8cd401f-8631-4310-8cf5-077e5179f3ff","a31b03cff7ce4570a611100887b0c69f","2025-06-24T06:24:43.9001366Z","rdhqALeKrF6gAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF6gAAAAAAAAAA==/","""2501913e-0000-1600-0000-685a44f80000""","attachments/","1750746360"

However, many elite climbers tend to be within a certain height range that offers advantages for certain climbing styles.
Generally, competitive lead climbers and sport climbers tend to be around 5'6"" to 5'11"" (168 cm to 180 cm). For example, notable climbers like Adam Ondra (around 5'10"" or 178 cm) and Janja Garnbret (around 5'5"" or 165 cm) fall within or near this range. 
It's important to note that climbing success is highly individual, and climbers of various heights can excel in different disciplines such as bouldering, lead climbing, or speed climbing. Height can influence reach and leverage, but technique, strength-to-weight ratio, and mental skills often matter more.

For elite male long-distance runners (e.g., marathoners and 10,000 meters), the average height is typically around **1.65 to 1.75 meters** (5 feet 5 inches to 5 feet 9 inches). Similarly, top female distance runners tend to be slightly shorter, often around **1.55 to 1.65 meters** (5 feet 1 inch to 5 feet 5 inches).
For sprinters, especially those competing in shorter distances like 100m and 200m, heights are more variable, but many successful sprinters are also within the 1.70 to 1.85 meters range.

In dem von Ihnen geschilderten Fall, in dem der Mann in Graubünden (GR) und die Frau in Zürich (ZH) gemeldet sind, ergeben sich folgende steuerliche Konsequenzen:
1. **Steuerdomizil**: 
   - Der Wohnsitz des Mannes ist in Graubünden, daher ist er in erster Linie in diesem Kanton steuerpflichtig.
   - Die Frau hat ihren Wohnsitz in Zürich und ist dort steuerpflichtig.
2. **Gemeinsame Besteuerung von Ehepaaren**: 
   - Ehepaare werden in der Schweiz normalerweise gemeinsam besteuert, und es wird eine gemeinsame Steuererklärung für das Paar erstellt. Der gemeinsame steuerliche Wohnsitz bestimmt, wo die Steuererklärung einzureichen ist und wo die Einkommenssteuerpflicht primär besteht.
   - Dieses gemeinsame Domizil ist in der Regel dort, wo sich der Mittelpunkt der Lebensinteressen des Ehepaars befindet. Dabei werden Aspekte wie familiäre Bindungen, der Ort der Arbeit und andere soziale Verbindungen berücksichtigt.
   - Aufgrund der unterschiedlichen Meldung sind möglicherweise besondere Abklärungen notwendig, um das korrekte bundes- und kantonale Steuerdomizil festzustellen.
3. **Immobilienbesteuerung**:
   - Das Ferienhaus in Graubünden würde auf Kantonsebene in Graubünden besteuert werden, unabhängig davon, wo der steuerliche Wohnsitz des Paares ist. In der Steuererklärung wird der Eigenmietwert dieser Liegenschaft erfasst, und es können kantonale Grundstückswerte oder Vermögenssteuersätze Anwendung finden.
   - Das Eigenheim in Zürich würde in Zürich in der Steuererklärung ebenfalls mit dem Eigenmietwert und dem Immobilienwert berücksichtigt werden.
4. **Steuererklärungen**:
   - Da beide Partner separate Wohnsitze haben, könnte theoretisch die Notwendigkeit bestehen, in beiden Kantonen Steuererklärungen auszufüllen, obwohl normalerweise ein Hauptdomizil definiert werden sollte.
   - Sie sollten sicherstellen, dass sowohl Einkommen und Vermögen als auch die jeweiligen Immobilien in beiden Kantonen korrekt angegeben werden, um Doppelbesteuerungen zu vermeiden.
Es ist ratsam, in solchen komplexen Fällen einen Steuerberater oder Fachperson für Steuerrecht zu konsultieren, um die genaue steuerliche Situation zu klären und um sicherzustellen, dass alle steuerlichen Verpflichtungen korrekt erfüllt werden.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":763,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2381,""usageInWh"":1.37402}","acd59ec7-3b87-4edf-833a-f3ba358a131d","a31b03cff7ce4570a611100887b0c69f","2025-06-24T08:23:45.7862339Z","rdhqALeKrF6oAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF6oAAAAAAAAAA==/","""2801321a-0000-1600-0000-685a60d10000""","attachments/","1750753489"

Es gibt jedoch einige wesentliche Punkte, die beachtet werden müssen, insbesondere wenn ein Ehepartner in Zürich (ZH) und der andere in Graubünden (GR) gemeldet ist.
### Gemeinsame Besteuerung:
1. **Gemeinsames Steuerdomizil:**
   - Obwohl die Ehepartner an unterschiedlichen Orten gemeldet sind, wird ein gemeinsames Steuerdomizil festgelegt, das in der Regel dort ist, wo der Mittelpunkt der Lebensinteressen des Ehepaares liegt. Dies kann der Ort sein, an dem das Paar die meiste Zeit verbringt, oder wo der soziale und wirtschaftliche Lebensmittelpunkt ist.
   - Sollte ein klarer Mittelpunkt nicht feststellbar sein, kann es zu einer Abklärung durch die Steuerbehörden kommen, die solche Fälle individuell prüfen.
2. **Einreichung der Steuererklärung:**
   - Aufgrund der ungetrennten Ehe wird in der Regel nur eine Steuererklärung für das gesamte Ehepaar eingereicht, basierend auf ihrem gemeinsamen Steuerdomizil.
   - Das bedeutet, dass, wenn der Lebensmittelpunkt in Zürich ist, die Steuererklärung dort eingereicht wird, und umgekehrt.
3. **Besteuerung der Immobilien:**
   - Das Ferienhaus in Graubünden muss für die Vermögens- und Einkommenssteuer (Eigenmietwert) in Graubünden deklariert werden.
   - Das Haus in Zürich wird in der Steuererklärung der Wohnkantone gemeldet, wobei Eigentum und eventuelle Hypotheken anteilsmäßig berücksichtigt werden.
### Praktische Schritte:
- **Klärung des Steuerdomizils:** Ermitteln Sie im Dialog mit den Steuerbehörden oder einem Steuerberater, wie das Hauptdomizil anzusetzen ist.
- **Einheitliche Steuererklärung:** Stellen Sie sicher, dass die Steuererklärung alle relevanten Einkünfte und Vermögenswerte beider Partner umfasst.
- **Vermögensdeklaration:** Beide Liegenschaften müssen korrekt in den jeweiligen Kantonen in Bezug auf Steuerwerte angegeben werden.
Bei Unklarheiten oder komplexeren Lebensumständen wird empfohlen, einen Steuerberater zu konsultieren, um sicherzustellen, dass alle steuerlichen Verpflichtungen korrekt und optimal erfüllt werden.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":1302,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2174,""usageInWh"":1.36008}","1fcff637-d095-4a27-b078-754b0420a487","a31b03cff7ce4570a611100887b0c69f","2025-06-24T08:26:38.2496612Z","rdhqALeKrF6pAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF6pAAAAAAAAAA==/","""2801c829-0000-1600-0000-685a61510000""","attachments/","1750753617"

We optimized it using the `filter` method. Since the solution provided earlier is already quite optimized in terms of readability and efficiency using ES6 `filter`, let's consider a more comprehensive approach that could be part of enhancing the overall class design:
Imagine you have an `IFileCategory` interface and a class managing these categories. Here's how you might further enhance the overall design:
### Original Code:
    const fileCategories: IFileCategory[] = [];
    for (const fileCategory of this._fileCategories) {
        if (!fileCategory.isDeleted) {
            fileCategories.push(fileCategory);
    return fileCategories;
### Improved Code with Context:
interface IFileCategory {
    isDeleted: boolean;
    // other properties...
class FileCategoryManager {
    private _fileCategories: IFileCategory[];
    constructor(fileCategories: IFileCategory[]) {
        this._fileCategories = fileCategories;
        return this._fileCategories.filter(fileCategory => !fileCategory.isDeleted);
    public addFileCategory(fileCategory: IFileCategory): void {
        this._fileCategories.push(fileCategory);
    public removeFileCategory(index: number): void {
        if (index >= 0 && index < this._fileCategories.length) {
            this._fileCategories.splice(index, 1);
    // More methods can be added as needed
const fileCategories: IFileCategory[] = [
    { isDeleted: false },
    { isDeleted: true },
    // Other file categories...
];
const manager = new FileCategoryManager(fileCategories);
console.log(manager.activeFileCategories);  // Outputs active categories only
1. **Encapsulation**: By encapsulating operations related to file categories in a `FileCategoryManager` class, you separate concerns and follow good OOP practices.
2. **Methods for Management**: Added methods for adding and removing file categories which make it easier to manage categories through a singular interface.
3. **Constructor Initialization**: Provides a way to initialize the manager with a list of categories, making the class easier to use and test.
This structure not only optimizes the specific getter method but also provides a more robust and extensible way to handle operations on file categories. This leaves the code open for easy additions or modifications, such as new file category operations or validations.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":248,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2787,""usageInWh"":1.49353}","ef3c2bb9-5c43-496d-acec-651baf3a9612","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-24T09:41:35.4084712Z","rdhqALeKrF6sAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF6sAAAAAAAAAA==/","""2a019d51-0000-1600-0000-685a72e30000""","attachments/","1750758115"

1. Use immutable patterns where appropriate.
2. Add better encapsulation: prevent external code from directly mutating the internal list.
3. Use method names that clearly express intent.
4. Add optional properties to `IFileCategory` for extensibility.
5. Include TypeScript best practices like readonly arrays for safe access and more flexible methods like `removeFileCategoryById`.
6. Add some comments for clarity.
Here's the improved version:
    id: string; // Unique identifier for the category
    private _fileCategories: IFileCategory[] = [];
    constructor(initialCategories?: IFileCategory[]) {
        if (initialCategories) {

    // Adds a new file category
    // Removes a file category by index
    public removeFileCategory(index: number): boolean {
            return true;
        return false;
    // Remove category by ID for safer removal
    public removeFileCategoryById(id: string): boolean {
        const index = this._fileCategories.findIndex(fc => fc.id === id);
        if (index !== -1) {
    // Optionally, get all categories
    public get allFileCategories(): ReadonlyArray<IFileCategory> {
        return this._fileCategories;
    // Set categories (if needed)
    public setFileCategories(categories: IFileCategory[]): void {
        this._fileCategories = [...categories];
// Example usage:
const initialCategories: IFileCategory[] = [
    { id: '1', isDeleted: false },
    { id: '2', isDeleted: true },
    { id: '3', isDeleted: false },
const manager = new FileCategoryManager(initialCategories);
console.log(manager.activeFileCategories); // Only active categories
// Adding a new category
manager.addFileCategory({ id: '4', isDeleted: false });
// Removing by ID
manager.removeFileCategoryById('2');
### Key improvements:
- **Unique identifiers (`id`)** instead of relying on index for removals, which is safer especially if categories might be reordered.
- **Read-only access** to internal array, preventing external mutation.
- **Flexible removal methods**.
- Better constructor initialization.
- Clarified code with comments.

However, I can provide some general information:
**Estimated Energy Consumption per AI Query:**
- Large-scale AI models like GPT-4 are energy-intensive during both training and inference.
- The energy used per individual inference (like this response) can vary depending on factors such as model size, hardware efficiency, data center infrastructure, and workload.
**Approximate Range:**
- Research estimates suggest that generating a single GPT-4 response could consume approximately **0.3 to 1 Wh** (watt-hours) of energy, though this is a rough approximation.
- Smaller models or optimized hardware can significantly reduce this per-query energy.
- The actual energy cost for this specific interaction may be lower or higher depending on the hardware and infrastructure specifics.
**Summary:**
- **Estimated energy for this prompt:** roughly **0.3 to 1 Wh** (very approximate).
- This is comparable to the energy used to power a small LED light for about 10-30 minutes.
*Please note:* Precise measurement would require detailed energy profiling of the data center hardware and infrastructure used, which is proprietary to OpenAI and hosting providers.

This hook ensures that the component's view, including its child views, has been fully initialized before performing any operations like scrolling.
Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:
### Step 1: Set Up Your Component
Create a component where you want to implement the scrolling functionality.
### Step 2: Use the `AfterViewInit` Lifecycle Hook
import { Component, AfterViewInit, ViewChild, ElementRef } from '@angular/core';
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: `
    <div style=""height: 100vh;"">Scroll Down to See the Element</div>
    <div #scrollToElement style=""height: 100px; background-color: lightblue;"">
      Scroll to this element!
    <div style=""height: 100vh;"">Another Section</div>
  `
export class MyComponent implements AfterViewInit {
  @ViewChild('scrollToElement') scrollToElement!: ElementRef;
  ngAfterViewInit() {
    this.scrollToElement.nativeElement.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
### Explanation
1. **Import Statements**: Import necessary Angular core features: `Component`, `AfterViewInit`, `ViewChild`, and `ElementRef`.
2. **Component Decorator**: Specify your component's metadata, including the selector and template.
3. **ViewChild**: Use the `@ViewChild` decorator to get a reference to the element you want to scroll to. In this case, we are using a template reference variable, `#scrollToElement`.
4. **AfterViewInit Implementation**: Implement the `ngAfterViewInit` method, which will execute after the component’s view has been fully initialized.
5. **scrollIntoView**: Call the `scrollIntoView()` method on the native element to scroll smoothly to the specified element.
### Step 3: Add Styles (Optional)
Optionally, you can add some CSS styles to better visualize the scrolling effect.
### Step 4: Import Your Component
Make sure to declare your component in the appropriate Angular module file so that it gets compiled and recognized by Angular.
### Bonus: Scroll to a Specific Position
If you want to scroll to a specific offset instead of just to the element, you can use the `window.scrollTo` method:
ngAfterViewInit() {
  const elementPosition = this.scrollToElement.nativeElement.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY;
  window.scrollTo({ top: elementPosition, behavior: 'smooth' });
### Note
- Ensure that you have enough content above the target element if you want to notice the scrolling effect. Otherwise, you may not see the scrolling if the element is already in view.
- Be aware of how many times this method will be called, particularly if the component is being re-rendered frequently, which may lead to unexpected behavior.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":8,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2841,""usageInWh"":0.8831}","b0b33352-4801-476b-badd-4e29f75d076f","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-24T11:33:08.735175Z","rdhqALeKrF65AAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF65AAAAAAAAAA==/","""2d012f7b-0000-1600-0000-685a8d0e0000""","attachments/","1750764814"

","0","gpt-4.1-nano","2","true","2025-06-24T12:00:31.319792Z","In Angular, dynamically loading a component involves creating the component at runtime rather than declaring it statically in the template. This is useful for scenarios like modals, dialogs, or dynamic forms.
### Basic steps to load a component dynamically:
1. **Make sure the component isn't embedded in any template directly**, or declare it in your module's `entryComponents` (Angular < 9) or just in the `declarations` (Angular 9++ with Ivy).
2. **Create a placeholder in your template**, typically with a directive like `ViewContainerRef`.
3. **Use `ComponentFactoryResolver` (Angular < 13)** or directly create a component via `ViewContainerRef.createComponent()` (Angular 13++ where `ComponentFactoryResolver` is deprecated).
### Example: Dynamically load a component in Angular 13+
Suppose you have a component called `MyDynamicComponent`.
**1. Create the component**
// my-dynamic.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
  selector: 'app-my-dynamic',
  template: `<p>This is a dynamic component!</p>`
export class MyDynamicComponent {}
**2. Prepare a placeholder in your host component**
In your host component's template:
<!-- host.component.html -->
<div>
  <ng-template #container></ng-template>
<button (click)=""loadComponent()"">Load Dynamic Component</button>
Notice the `#container` template reference.
**3. Load the component dynamically in your host component**
// host.component.ts
import { Component, ViewChild, ViewContainerRef, AfterViewInit } from '@angular/core';
import { MyDynamicComponent } from './my-dynamic.component';
  selector: 'app-host',
  templateUrl: './host.component.html'
export class HostComponent {
  @ViewChild('container', { read: ViewContainerRef }) container!: ViewContainerRef;
  loadComponent() {
    // Clear previous components if needed
    this.container.clear();
    // Create the component dynamically
    this.container.createComponent(MyDynamicComponent);
### Important notes:
- **For Angular versions prior to 13:** You often need to use `ComponentFactoryResolver` to resolve and create components.
- **For Angular 13+ with Ivy:** You can directly call `createComponent()` on `ViewContainerRef`.
- **Entry Components:** Angular Ivy (v9+) no longer requires listing entry components explicitly.
- Use `ViewChild` to get a `ViewContainerRef`.
- Call `createComponent()` on that `ViewContainerRef`.
- Pass the component class you want to load.

Eine gängige Methode ist die Berechnung der **Bruttorendite** und der **Nettorendite**. 
### 1. Bruttorendite
Die Bruttorendite wird in der Regel auf der Basis des gesamten Mietzinses (oder Gewinns) im Verhältnis zum Verkehrswert der Liegenschaft berechnet:
\[
\text{Bruttorendite} = \left( \frac{\text{Jahresgewinn}}{\text{Verkehrswert der Liegenschaft}} \right) \times 100
\]
Wenn wir die Werte aus deinen Angaben verwenden:
- **Jahresgewinn**: CHF 123'000
- **Verkehrswert der Liegenschaft**: CHF 2'500'000 bis CHF 3'000'000
#### Berechnung der Bruttorendite:
1. **Für die Untergrenze (2.5 Mio)**:
\text{Bruttorendite} = \left( \frac{123'000}{2'500'000} \right) \times 100 \approx 4.92\%
2. **Für die Obergrenze (3 Mio)**:
\text{Bruttorendite} = \left( \frac{123'000}{3'000'000} \right) \times 100 \approx 4.10\%
### 2. Nettorendite
Die Nettorendite berechnet sich, nachdem man alle Betriebskosten und mögliche Hypothekarzinsen vom Gewinn abgezogen hat. Es ist wichtig, diese Kosten zu berücksichtigen, um eine genauere Vorstellung von der tatsächlichen Rendite zu erhalten.
Angenommen, es gibt Betriebskosten und Zinsen, die den Gewinn beeinflussen, die echte Nettorendite könnte als:
\text{Nettorendite} = \left( \frac{\text{Reingewinn}}{\text{Eigenkapital}} \right) \times 100
### Eigenkapital
Das Eigenkapital (EK) lässt sich aus dem Verkehrswert und dem Fremdkapital (FK) berechnen:
EK = \text{Verkehrswert} - \text{Fremdkapital} = 2'500'000 \text{ bis } 3'000'000 - 2'000'000
- **Für die Untergrenze (2.5 Mio)**: 
  - \( EK = 2'500'000 - 2'000'000 = 500'000 \)
- **Für die Obergrenze (3 Mio)**: 
  - \( EK = 3'000'000 - 2'000'000 = 1'000'000 \)
### Beispiel für Nettorendite (ohne zusätzliche Informationen zu Betriebskosten):
Wenn es keine weiteren Kosten zu berücksichtigen gibt, bleibt der Gewinn CHF 123'000. Wir nehmen beide Szenarien für das Eigenkapital:
1. **Für 2.5 Mio (Eigenkapital 500'000)**:
\text{Nettorendite} = \left( \frac{123'000}{500'000} \right) \times 100 \approx 24.6\%
2. **Für 3.0 Mio (Eigenkapital 1'000'000)**:
\text{Nettorendite} = \left( \frac{123'000}{1'000'000} \right) \times 100 \approx 12.3\%
### Fazit
- Die **Bruttorendite** liegt zwischen etwa 4.1% und 4.9%, was für Immobilien durchschnittlich ist.
- Die **Nettorendite** kann stark variieren, abhängig von den tatsächlichen Betriebskosten. Sie kann hohe Werte erreichen (24.6% für das niedrigere Eigenkapital), wenn sehr wenig Fremdkapital benötigt wird im Verhältnis zum Gewinn.
Für eine genaue Beurteilung sollte auch die Marktlage, das Risiko, die Lage der Liegenschaft und alle laufenden Kosten berücksichtigt werden. Ein Immobilienexperte könnte hier weitere wertvolle Einsichten geben.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":1632,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2849,""usageInWh"":1.0479}","8f640e4d-e5a3-4820-9c38-56b223b14974","a31b03cff7ce4570a611100887b0c69f","2025-06-24T12:51:26.4071381Z","rdhqALeKrF69AAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF69AAAAAAAAAA==/","""2f0174b5-0000-1600-0000-685a9f600000""","attachments/","1750769504"

UPDATE MAY-JUNE 2025
Greetings to you all in the precious name of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
The new academic year has begun for the kids at the orphanage.
Please pray for this humble ministry that has faced tremendous hardship and local
society resistance.
Every year as the rains lash, our old structures continually suffer water seepage and
leaks needing annual maintenance.
Over the years this outreach has helped many kids grow in the knowledge of our Lord
Jesus Christ in His saving faith and have started churches across India. As God enables
me, I shall share success stories so it may encourage you all .
“The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: Thy mercy, O LORD, endureth

thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and
ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick,

me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying,
Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee?
or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a
stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed
thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and
came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say
unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye
have done it unto one of the least of these my
brethren, ye have done it unto me.”

Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in
their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from

AKTUALISIERUNG MAI-JUNI 2025
Grüße an euch alle im kostbaren Namen unseres Herrn und Erlösers Jesus Christus. Das neue Schuljahr hat für die Kinder im Waisenhaus begonnen. Bitte betet für diesen demütigen Dienst, der mit enormen Schwierigkeiten und Widerstand in der lokalen Gesellschaft konfrontiert war. Jedes Jahr, wenn der Regen niederprasselt, erleiden unsere alten Gebäude weiterhin Wassereinbrüche und Lecks, die jährliche Wartung erfordern.
Im Laufe der Jahre hat diese Outreach viele Kinder im Wissen unseres Herrn Jesus Christus in seinem rettenden Glauben wachsen lassen und Kirchen in ganz Indien gegründet. Wie Gott es ermöglicht, werde ich Erfolgsgeschichten teilen, um euch alle zu ermutigen. 
„Der HERR wird alles für mich vollbringen. HERR, deine Gnade währt ewig. Lass nicht die Werke deiner Hände los.“ 
Psalm 138,8 (LUT)
Der Wasserreiniger und der Bereich zum Händewaschen brauchen einen Anstrich und Wartung.
Elektrische Wartung
Die Küchenausstattung wird gewartet.
Gott stellt Literatur zur Verteilung in Chennai für 200 Missionare bereit, die in den Dörfern arbeiten.
Papa und Titus reisten in ein nahegelegenes Dorf in der Nähe von Hassan, um zu dienen und auch die örtlichen Missionare mit Kleidung zu unterstützen.
Wie Gott es ermöglicht, helfen wir weiterhin den Bedürftigen mit monatlichen Rationen für alleinstehende ältere Frauen in Not. Diese kostbaren Leben, einst verlassen, haben in seiner Gnade Trost gefunden. Wie es geschrieben steht:
„Denn ich war hungrig, und ihr habt mir zu essen gegeben; ich war durstig, und ihr habt mir zu trinken gegeben; ich war ein Fremder, und ihr habt mich aufgenommen; ich war nackt, und ihr habt mich gekleidet; ich war krank, und ihr habt mich besucht; ich war im Gefängnis, und ihr seid zu mir gekommen. Dann werden ihm die Gerechten antworten und sagen: Herr, wann sahen wir dich hungrig und speisten dich? oder durstig und gaben dir zu trinken? Wann sahen wir dich als Fremden und nahmen dich auf? oder nackt und kleideten dich? Wann sahen wir dich krank oder im Gefängnis und kamen zu dir? Und der König wird ihnen antworten und sagen: Wahrlich, ich sage euch: So wie ihr es einem dieser meiner geringsten Brüder getan habt, habt ihr es mir getan.“
Matthäus 25,35-40 (LUT)
„Ein reiner und unbefleckter Gottesdienst vor Gott und dem Vater ist der, die Waisen und Witwen in ihrer Bedrängnis zu besuchen und sich unbefleckt von der Welt zu bewahren.“ 
Jakobus 1,27 (LUT)
Vielen Dank, dass ihr uns im Gebet und in der Unterstützung beisteht, damit wir seine Liebe durch die Verkündigung des Evangeliums ehren können. Im Glauben bereiten wir uns auf die medizinische Outreach in der ersten Juliwoche vor. Weitere Updates folgen. Die Fahrzeuge benötigen etwas Wartung und Versicherung; wir lassen sie für die Reise reparieren. Wir vertrauen Gott in allem und durch alles hindurch.
„Der HERR wird alles für mich vollbringen. HERR, deine Gnade währt ewig. Lass nicht die Werke deiner Hände los.“
Wir preisen Gott für die Möglichkeiten, die er gibt. Gott sei die Ehre,

Here are a few considerations and steps you might take:
1. **Character Count Management**: Implement a function that dynamically counts the total characters of your note, including all sections you're sending. This will help you understand how close you are to the limit.
2. **Conditionally Split Notes**: If your notes consistently approach or exceed the character limit, it would be prudent to implement a strategy for splitting notes. This could be done by breaking down sections or finding logical ""breakpoints"" in your content where notes can be divided without losing context or meaning.
3. **Optimize Content**: Review each section for verbosity. Sometimes, content can be efficiently condensed without losing important information.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for when notes near or exceed the limit, with clear fallback actions such as truncating non-essential sections, notifying users, or automatically splitting notes.
5. **Testing and Monitoring**: Test your implementation to ensure that notes are correctly split and formatted, and monitor the actual size of notes being sent over time to adjust your strategy as necessary.
6. **Scalability Considerations**: While planning for future growth or content expansion, keep scalability in mind. If your data or user input is likely to increase significantly, have your system scalable to adapt to that growth.
Planning ahead by implementing these strategies can prevent system rejection issues and improve the robustness of your data handling. If your notes are often around the upper limit or expected to grow, preparing your system for splitting notes is a wise decision.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":112,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1830,""usageInWh"":0.98234}","4b7afa52-257e-46a3-98cf-133de718dc27","e6c6fdc37f5247779986718dd20d086e","2025-06-24T18:36:48.0044677Z","rdhqALeKrF7CAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7CAAAAAAAAAA==/","""38013648-0000-1600-0000-685af09d0000""","attachments/","1750790301"

Schrödinger's Cat is a famous thought experiment proposed by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935 to illustrate some of the peculiar aspects of quantum mechanics.
Here's the basic idea:
Imagine a sealed box containing:
- A live cat
- A radioactive atom
- A Geiger counter (a device that detects radiation)
- A vial of poison
The setup is designed so that:
- If the radioactive atom decays (which is a random quantum event), the Geiger counter detects it.
- Detection triggers the release of poison, killing the cat.
- If the atom does not decay, the cat remains alive.
According to quantum mechanics, until we look inside the box, the atom exists in a superposition of decayed and undecayed states. Because the fate of the cat depends on the atom's state, the cat is also considered to be in a superposition: both alive and dead simultaneously.
Only when someone opens the box and observes the system does the superposition ""collapse"" into one definite state—either the cat is alive or dead.
Schrödinger's Cat illustrates how quantum particles can exist in multiple states at once until measured, highlighting the strange and non-intuitive nature of quantum physics. It also raises questions about the role of observation and measurement in determining reality.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":8,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1293,""usageInWh"":0.29709}","ce4621ce-1744-437d-ab16-57959e2ac468","90d6086d99f54dbaa068194917cd7aa7","2025-06-24T19:42:49.5877329Z","rdhqALeKrF7HAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7HAAAAAAAAAA==/","""3901e9b0-0000-1600-0000-685b00490000""","attachments/","1750794313"

Es wurde von der Supply Chain Council (SCC) ins Leben gerufen und wird häufig als Referenzstandard für das Supply Chain Management verwendet. Das SCOR-Modell bietet eine gemeinsame Sprache und Struktur, um verschiedene Aspekte der Lieferkette zu analysieren, zu bewerten und zu optimieren.
### Die fünf Hauptprozesse des SCOR-Modells
1. **Plan (Planen)**:
   - Umfasst alle Aktivitäten, die notwendig sind, um die Nachfrage zu prognostizieren und die Ressourcen effizient zu planen. Dies beinhaltet Bedarfsplanung, Kapazitätsplanung und die Entwicklung von Supply-Chain-Strategien.
2. **Source (Beschaffen)**:
   - Bezieht sich auf die Auswahl und Verwaltung von Lieferanten sowie auf den Einkauf der erforderlichen Rohstoffe und Waren. Dazu gehören Aktivitäten wie Lieferantenauswahl, Bestellung und Empfang von Materialien.
3. **Make (Herstellen)**:
   - Umfasst die Produktherstellung und den Produktionsprozess. Dies beinhaltet die Umwandlung von Rohstoffen in fertige Produkte, einschließlich der Produktionsplanung und -ausführung.
4. **Deliver (Liefern)**:
   - Bezieht sich auf die Logistik und das Management der Lieferung von Produkten an den Kunden. Dazu gehören der Versand, die Auftragsabwicklung und das Management von Transport und Lagerbeständen.
5. **Return (Rückgabe)**:
   - Umfasst die Rückführung von Produkten, sei es aufgrund von Defekten oder Retouren. Dieser Prozess ist wichtig für die Kundenbindung und das Management von Reklamationen und Rücksendungen.
### Performance-Messung
Das SCOR-Modell bietet auch einen Rahmen zur Leistungsbewertung, einschließlich wichtiger Kennzahlen (KPIs) wie:
- Liefertreue
- Bestandsgenauigkeit
- Kosten der Logistik
- Produktionszykluszeiten
### Vorteile des SCOR-Modells
- **Eindeutige Terminologie**: Es schafft eine gemeinsame Sprache für alle Beteiligten in der Lieferkette.
- **Prozessstandardisierung**: Es hilft Unternehmen, ihre Prozesse zu standardisieren und Best Practices zu identifizieren.
- **Benchmarking**: Unternehmen können ihre Leistung mit anderen vergleichen, um Verbesserungspotenziale zu identifizieren.
- **Integration und Zusammenarbeit**: Fördert die Zusammenarbeit zwischen den verschiedenen Akteuren in der Lieferkette.
Das SCOR-Modell ist ein nützliches Instrument für Organisationen, die ihre Lieferketten strategisch planen und optimieren möchten, um wettbewerbsfähig zu bleiben und Kosten zu minimieren.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":9,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2580,""usageInWh"":0.8049}","9b0f2b4c-a7f4-4ae9-847c-bc9c60aa5eb6","bf0bc8a3dade408a906a467797eb0563","2025-06-24T20:14:42.8285825Z","rdhqALeKrF7JAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7JAAAAAAAAAA==/","""3a01ac4b-0000-1600-0000-685b073e0000""","attachments/","1750796094"

1. **Frauen**: Etwa 2,1 Liter (ca. 9 Tassen) Flüssigkeit pro Tag.
2. **Männer**: Etwa 2,6 Liter (ca. 13 Tassen) Flüssigkeit pro Tag.
3. **Besondere Umstände**: Bei körperlicher Aktivität, heißem Wetter oder Schwangerschaft kann der Flüssigkeitsbedarf erhöht sein.
### Tipps zur ausreichenden Flüssigkeitszufuhr:
- **Wasser trinken**: Wasser ist die beste Quelle. Achte darauf, den ganzen Tag über regelmäßig zu trinken.
- **Lebensmittel**: Viele Lebensmittel, insbesondere Obst und Gemüse, haben einen hohen Wassergehalt und tragen zur Flüssigkeitsaufnahme bei.
- **Durstgefühl**: Höre auf deinen Körper. Durst ist ein natürlicher Indikator für den Flüssigkeitsbedarf.
Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass individuelle Bedürfnisse variieren können. Wenn du unsicher bist oder spezielle gesundheitliche Bedenken hast, ist es ratsam, mit einem Arzt oder Ernährungsberater zu sprechen.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":571,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1233,""usageInWh"":0.457}","7eb27e66-e8e6-4bb2-adbf-0d608fbf69f5","bf0bc8a3dade408a906a467797eb0563","2025-06-24T20:15:29.7555412Z","rdhqALeKrF7KAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7KAAAAAAAAAA==/","""3a011750-0000-1600-0000-685b07750000""","attachments/","1750796149"

By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take Hierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B).

Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this refHierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference Hierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B).

Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from tHierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the AnguHierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular vHierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular v17 doHierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B).

By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular v17 documentation as Hierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B).

By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular v17 documentation as reference for Hierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B).

By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular v17 documentation as reference for the following Hierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B).

By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular v17 documentation as reference for the following Questions:Hierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B).

By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular v17 documentation as reference for the following Questions:\nHierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A).""]","Take this reference from the Angular v17 documentation as reference for the following Questions:
Hierarchical injectors
Injectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.

The applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.
There can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.
With hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.
Types of injector hierarchies
Angular has two injector hierarchies:
INJECTOR HIERARCHIES	DETAILS
EnvironmentInjector hierarchy	Configure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.
ElementInjector hierarchy	Created implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().
NGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS
For NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.
EnvironmentInjector
The EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:
The @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform
The ApplicationConfig providers array
TREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()
Using the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.
Tree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.
EnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.
Provide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:
content_copy
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector
export class ItemService {
  name = 'telephone';
The @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.
ModuleInjector
In the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:
The @NgModule() providers array
ModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.
Child ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.
Platform injector
There are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().
Consider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);
The bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.
The platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.
The next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.
The following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.
NullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector
While the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.
All requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.
@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG
If you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.
Here is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.
providers: [
  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }
]
For NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.
ElementInjector
Angular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.
Providing a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:
  …
  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]
export class TestComponent
See the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.
When you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.
When the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.
@Directive() and @Component()
A component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.
Resolution rules
When resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:
Against its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.
Against its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.
When a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.
The requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.
If Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.
If you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.
For NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.
Resolution modifiers
Angular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.
For a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.
Types of modifiers
Resolution modifiers fall into three categories:
What to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()
Where to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()
Where to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()
By default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.
Additionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:
@Host() and @Self()
@SkipSelf() and @Self().
@Optional()
@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.
src/app/optional/optional.component.ts
export class OptionalComponent {
  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}
@Self()
Use @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.
A good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().
For example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.
src/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-self-no-data',
  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']
export class SelfNoDataComponent {
  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }
In this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.
Another example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.
src/app/self/self.component.ts
  selector: 'app-self',
  templateUrl: './self.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],
  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]
export class SelfComponent {
  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}
@SkipSelf()
@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.
To see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:
src/app/leaf.service.ts
export class LeafService {
  emoji = '🌿';
Imagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():
src/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts
  selector: 'app-skipself',
  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],
  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance
  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]
export class SkipselfComponent {
  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor
  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }
In this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.
@SkipSelf() with @Optional()
Use @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.
class Person {
  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}
@Host()
@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:
src/app/host/host.component.ts
  templateUrl: './host.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],
  //  provide the service
  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],
  imports: [HostChildComponent]
  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service
  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }
Since HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.
Logical structure of the template
When you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.
Understanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.
Components are used in your templates, as in the following example:
<app-root>
  <app-child></app-child>
</app-root>
Usually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.
The following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:
  <#VIEW>
    <app-child>
     <#VIEW>
       …content goes here…
     </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
Understanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.
Providing services in @Component()
How you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().
A component class can provide services in two ways:
ARRAYS	DETAILS
With a providers array	
@Component({ 
  … 
  providers: [ 
    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} 
  ] 
With a viewProviders array	
 viewProviders: [ 
    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} 
To understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.
In the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.
ANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE	DETAILS
@Inject(Token)=>Value
Demonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.
@Provide(Token=Value)
Demonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.
ApplicationConfig(Token)
Demonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.
Example app structure
The example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.
src/app/flower.service.ts
  providedIn: 'root'
export class FlowerService {
  emoji = '🌺';
Consider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:
<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->
    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->
However, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:
    <#VIEW>
        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->
            <#VIEW>
            </#VIEW>
        </app-child>
    </#VIEW>
The <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.
Knowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.
Now, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:
src/app/app.component.ts
export class AppComponent  {
  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}
Add a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:
src/app/app.component.html
<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>
The output in the view would be:
Emoji from FlowerService: 🌺
In the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:
<app-root ApplicationConfig
        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>""🌺"">
    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>
      <#VIEW>
      </#VIEW>
When <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:
The injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.
If the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.
In the example case, the constraints are:
Start with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.
Normally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.
The ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.
The ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.
Using the providers array
Now, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:
src/app/child.component.ts
  selector: 'app-child',
  templateUrl: './child.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],
  // use the providers array to provide a service
  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]
export class ChildComponent {
  // inject the service
  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }
Now that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.
The next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.
src/app/child.component.html
To render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:
Child Component
Emoji from FlowerService: 🌻
In the logical tree, this is represented as follows:
    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=""🌻"")
               @Inject(FlowerService)=>""🌻""> <!-- search ends here -->
      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->
        <h2>Child Component</h2>
        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>
When <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.
Using the viewProviders array
Use the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.
The steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.
For step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.
The example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.
First, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:
src/app/animal.service.ts
export class AnimalService {
  emoji = '🐳';
Following the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:
  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}
You can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.
Add a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.
  // provide services
  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],
  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],
  imports: [InspectorComponent]
  // inject service
  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }
Add bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:
<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>
Additionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:
Now you should see both values in the browser:
AppComponent
Emoji from AnimalService: 🐳
Emoji from AnimalService: 🐶
The logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:
         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>""🐳"">
      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=""🐶"")
            @Inject(AnimalService=>""🐶"")>
       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->
       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>
Just as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.
providers vs. viewProviders
To see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:
src/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts
export class InspectorComponent {
  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }
You do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:
src/app/inspector/inspector.component.html
Remember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.
src/app/child/child.component.ts
  ...
Next, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:
src/app/child/child.component.html
<div class=""container"">
  <h3>Content projection</h3>
	<ng-content></ng-content>
<h3>Inside the view</h3>
<app-inspector></app-inspector>
The first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.
Next, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.
<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>
The browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:
//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.
Content projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see
puppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.
These four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.
The next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.
The AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:
        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->
        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>
        <div class=""container"">
          <h3>Content projection</h3>
          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>""🐳"">
            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>
          </app-inspector>
        <app-inspector>
          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>""🐶"">
            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>
          </#VIEW>
        </app-inspector>
The projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.
Modifying service visibility
This section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().
Visibility of provided tokens
Visibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.
To alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:
constructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }
With @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:
In a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:
    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=""🌻"")>
      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>""🌺"">
        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->
Though <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.
If you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:
  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->
    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=""🌻"")> <!-- start search here -->
      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>
      </app-parent>
Here, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.
The example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.
@SkipSelf() and viewProviders
The <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.
As in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.
  // add @SkipSelf()
  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }
Instead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:
  viewProviders:
  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]
The logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:
          @Inject(AnimalService=>""🐳"")>
  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->
             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>""🐳"")>
        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->
With @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.
@Host() and viewProviders
If you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:
  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }
@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.
             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>""🐶"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->
Add a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],
  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]
Next, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:
  constructor(
  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }
When @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.
However, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.
The logical tree representation shows why this is:
        @Inject(AnimalService=>""🐳"")>
  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=""🦔"")
         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>""🦔"">
    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->
             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>""🦔"">
               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->
      </app-child>
@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.
ElementInjector use case examples
The ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.
Scenario: service isolation
Architectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.
If you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.
Instead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:
src/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)
  selector: 'app-villains-list',
  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',
  providers: [ VillainsService ],
  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]
By providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.
VillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.
Scenario: multiple edit sessions
Many applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.
To demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.
To open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.
Each tax return component has the following characteristics:
Is its own tax return editing session
Can change a tax return without affecting a return in another component
Has the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them
Heroes in action
Suppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.
The HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.
src/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts
import { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';
import { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';
@Injectable()
export class HeroTaxReturnService {
  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;
  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;
  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }
  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {
    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;
    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();
  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {
    return this.currentTaxReturn;
  restoreTaxReturn() {
    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;
  saveTaxReturn() {
    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;
    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();
Here is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.
src/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts
import { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';
import { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',
  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',
  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],
  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],
The tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.
This won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.
To prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.
src/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)
providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],
The HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.
The rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.
Scenario: specialized providers
Another reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.
For example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.
The root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.
Car component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.
Child component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).
Child component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.
car components
Behind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.
When you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:
An instance of Car resolved by injector (C)
An Engine resolved by injector (B)
Its Tires resolved by the root injector (A).","0","gpt-4.1-nano","2","true","2025-06-25T05:51:03.379844Z","Great!

Below are the steps and code snippets that will guide you through the process.
### Step 1: Create a Standalone Component
First, you need to create a standalone component that will accept inputs. Here is an example component named `DynamicComponent` that takes a title and a description.
// dynamic.component.ts
import { Component, Input, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
  selector: 'app-dynamic',
    <h3>{{ title }}</h3>
    <p>{{ description }}</p>
export class DynamicComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() title!: string;
  @Input() description!: string;
    console.log('DynamicComponent initialized with title:', this.title);
    console.log('DynamicComponent initialized with description:', this.description);
### Step 2: Create the Host Component
Next, create a component that will host the dynamic component. This component will use `ViewContainerRef` to create the dynamic component at runtime.
import { Component, ComponentFactoryResolver, OnInit, ViewChild, ViewContainerRef } from '@angular/core';
import { DynamicComponent } from './dynamic.component';
    <ng-container #dynamicContainer></ng-container>
    <button (click)=""addDynamicComponent()"">Add Dynamic Component</button>
export class HostComponent implements OnInit {
  @ViewChild('dynamicContainer', { read: ViewContainerRef }) dynamicContainer!: ViewContainerRef;
  constructor(private componentFactoryResolver: ComponentFactoryResolver) {}
  ngOnInit() {}
  addDynamicComponent() {
    const componentFactory = this.componentFactoryResolver.resolveComponentFactory(DynamicComponent);
    const dynamicComponentRef = this.dynamicContainer.createComponent(componentFactory);
    // Set inputs for the dynamic component
    dynamicComponentRef.instance.title = 'Dynamic Title';
    dynamicComponentRef.instance.description = 'This is a dynamically generated component!';
    // You can also subscribe to input changes here if needed
    dynamicComponentRef.instance.ngOnInit(); // Manually call ngOnInit to access the inputs
### Step 3: Update the Angular Module
In the `AppModule`, make sure to declare both components and set `DynamicComponent` as a standalone component in the imports.
// app.module.ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { HostComponent } from './host.component';
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    DynamicComponent // Import the standalone component here
  ],
  declarations: [HostComponent],
  bootstrap: [HostComponent]
export class AppModule {}
### Step 4: Run the Application
Now you can run your Angular application (typically via `ng serve`) and click the button to create instances of the `DynamicComponent`. You'll see the title and description logged to the console when created.
In this example:
- We created a standalone dynamic component (`DynamicComponent`) that takes `title` and `description` as inputs.
- A host component (`HostComponent`) is responsible for rendering the `DynamicComponent` dynamically upon button click.
- We used `ViewContainerRef` to create the dynamic instance and set the inputs before initializing.
With Angular v17's features, you can leverage this approach to dynamically create components while maintaining clean and manageable code.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":9650,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3813,""usageInWh"":2.1389}","799d1ccb-e663-49f1-82fc-bfd89a67bf50","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-25T05:51:12.3000848Z","rdhqALeKrF7MAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7MAAAAAAAAAA==/","""4401955f-0000-1600-0000-685b8e9d0000""","attachments/","1750830749"

Here's a complete example using the `ViewContainerRef` to dynamically create a component, leveraging the provided injector and environment injector:
### Step 1: Adjust the Code to Dynamically Create `WorkItemComponent`
We'll assume that `WorkItemComponent` is defined to accept some inputs from the provided `workItemInfo`. Below is how you can modify the code accordingly:
import { ViewContainerRef, createEnvironmentInjector, inject } from '@angular/core';
import { WorkItemComponent } from 'src/app/modules/work-item/work-item.component'; // Make sure to import properly
// Assuming this code snippet is part of a function or method within a component or service
const viewContainerRef = inject(ViewContainerRef);
// Create an environment injector to pass data into the WorkItemComponent
const envInjector = createEnvironmentInjector(
    [
            provide: 'workItemInfo', // Token for dependency injection
            useValue: this.outletInfo // The data you want to pass in
        },
    ],
    this.injector // The parent injector context
// Clear the ViewContainerRef to ensure no previous instances exist
viewContainerRef.clear();
// Dynamically create the WorkItemComponent
viewContainerRef.createComponent(WorkItemComponent, {
    environmentInjector: envInjector // Pass the environment injector
});
### Step 2: Ensure WorkItemComponent Receives the Input Correctly
In your `WorkItemComponent`, you should ensure that you are set up to receive the injected value through `@Inject`.
**Example WorkItemComponent:**
import { Component, Inject, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
  selector: 'app-work-item',
    <div>Work Item Info: {{ workItemInfo | json }}</div>
export class WorkItemComponent implements OnInit {
  workItemInfo: any;
  constructor(@Inject('workItemInfo') private info: any) {}
    this.workItemInfo = this.info; // Set the injected value
### Step 3: Ensure Module Imports
In your `WorkItemModule`, ensure that the `WorkItemComponent` is declared and exported properly.
**Example WorkItemModule:**
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { WorkItemComponent } from './work-item.component';
  declarations: [WorkItemComponent],
  imports: [CommonModule],
  exports: [WorkItemComponent] // Export the component if needed elsewhere
export class WorkItemModule {}
- The environment injector allows you to pass in tokens defined at the point of creation for dependency injection.
- The `WorkItemComponent` must utilize the `@Inject` decorator to access the data provided via the newly created environment injector.
- Make sure to import `WorkItemComponent` correctly from its module to ensure that Angular can find and use it.
- Clear the `ViewContainerRef` before creating a new instance to prevent any conflicts with previously created components.
This setup should allow for dynamic creation of your `WorkItemComponent` while properly passing in the `outletInfo` as expected.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":10547,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3430,""usageInWh"":2.1137}","ab0bf7ac-91e8-4871-9017-f47076a8f112","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-25T05:53:53.3691963Z","rdhqALeKrF7OAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7OAAAAAAAAAA==/","""44015b70-0000-1600-0000-685b8f2b0000""","attachments/","1750830891"

This is often used for lazy-loading modules in Angular. Below is the modified version of your code to dynamically import the `WorkItemModule` before creating the `WorkItemComponent`.
### Step 1: Modify the Code to Dynamically Import WorkItemModule
Here's an example of how you can achieve this with the dynamic import:
// Dynamically import the WorkItemModule and then create the component
import('src/app/modules/work-item/work-item.module').then(({ WorkItemModule }) => {
  // Create an environment injector to pass data into the WorkItemComponent
  const envInjector = createEnvironmentInjector(
      [
          {
              provide: 'workItemInfo', // Token for dependency injection
              useValue: this.outletInfo // The data you want to pass in
          },
      ],
      this.injector // The parent injector context
  );
  // Clear the ViewContainerRef to ensure no previous instances exist
  viewContainerRef.clear();
  // Create the WorkItemComponent dynamically
  const componentFactory = viewContainerRef.createComponent(WorkItemComponent, {
      environmentInjector: envInjector // Pass the environment injector
  });
  // Optional: You can handle the created component instance if needed
  const instance = componentFactory.instance;
### Explanation of the Code
1. **Dynamic Import**: 
   - The `import()` function is used to dynamically load the `WorkItemModule`. This returns a promise that you can then resolve to obtain the module.
2. **Using the Environment Injector**:
   - As before, you create an environment injector to provide any necessary dependencies to the component you're about to create.
   - You configure it with a provided value (`this.outletInfo`) for the token `'workItemInfo'`.
3. **ViewContainerRef**:
   - You clear the `ViewContainerRef` to avoid conflicts with any previously created components.
4. **Creating the Component**:
   - Finally, the `WorkItemComponent` is created using the `createComponent` method, with the `environmentInjector` passed in.
To make this work:
- **Ensure Proper Module Exports**: Confirm that `WorkItemComponent` is properly exported from the `WorkItemModule`.
- **Lazy Loading**: Using dynamic imports allows you to lazy-load components and modules, improving your application's performance by reducing the initial load time.
- **Handling Promises**: Make sure to handle any errors that may arise from the dynamic import properly in a production application.
### Additional Considerations
If you need to access the actual component type—`WorkItemComponent`—from the dynamically imported module, you'll typically have to export that component from the module like so:
  exports: [WorkItemComponent] // Make sure to export the component here
You can also organize the structure if you're planning to use many dynamic imports, potentially making it cleaner based on your project needs.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":11275,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3432,""usageInWh"":2.1871}","ffd15379-7d0d-4951-8e30-0ea73c772dcd","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-25T05:58:17.8311283Z","rdhqALeKrF7RAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7RAAAAAAAAAA==/","""4401d48b-0000-1600-0000-685b900b0000""","attachments/","1750831115"

This typically means that `inject()` is being called in a function outside of Angular's DI context, such as within a promise or outside the lifecycle hooks or constructors where DI addresses are available.
### Solution
To dynamically import and create a component while still being able to use `inject()`, the best approach is to wrap the import and subsequent actions in an Angular lifecycle method or in a method that is called in that context. This ensures that the required injection context is available.
Here's how you can modify your code:
1. **Wrap the dynamic import and component creation in a method of the component or inside a lifecycle hook.**
2. **Use `inject()` within the appropriate scope.**
### Updated Example
Let's say you want to create a method within an Angular component where you'll dynamically import `WorkItemModule` and create `WorkItemComponent`. Here's how to do it correctly:
import { Component, ViewContainerRef, inject, Injector } from '@angular/core';
import { createEnvironmentInjector } from '@angular/core';
import { WorkItemComponent } from 'src/app/modules/work-item/work-item.component'; // Import here if statically needed
  selector: 'app-your-component',
  template: `<button (click)=""createWorkItemComponent()"">Add Work Item</button>`, // Button to trigger creation
export class YourComponent {
  outletInfo = { /* your data here */ }; // Replace with actual data
  constructor(private viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef, private injector: Injector) {}
  createWorkItemComponent() {
    // Use dynamic import
    import('src/app/modules/work-item/work-item.module').then(({ WorkItemModule }) => {
      // Create the environment injector for dependency injection
      const envInjector = createEnvironmentInjector(
        [
            provide: 'workItemInfo', // Token for DI
            useValue: this.outletInfo, // Value to inject
        ],
        this.injector // Parent injector context
      );
      this.viewContainerRef.clear(); // Clear previous components
      // Dynamically create the WorkItemComponent
      const componentRef = this.viewContainerRef.createComponent(WorkItemComponent, {
        environmentInjector: envInjector,
      });
      // Optional: Do something with the component instance here
      const instance = componentRef.instance;
      console.log('Component created:', instance);
    }).catch(err => {
      console.error('Error loading module:', err); // Handle import errors
    });
### Key Changes and Explanation:
1. **Injection Context**: The `inject()` function is called within the constructor and methods of the Angular component class, ensuring that it has the correct injection context.
2. **Dynamic Import**: The import of `WorkItemModule` is wrapped in the `createWorkItemComponent` method, so you ensure that everything is executed in a context where Angular's DI is available.
3. **Error Handling**: Made sure to catch errors that can occur during the asynchronous import of the module.
### Alternative Without Static Import:
If `WorkItemComponent` is not needed statically, but you only want to import it dynamically, you can remove the static import and just ensure you're dealing with the component inside the dynamic import:
- You would then need to reference `WorkItemComponent` after importing it dynamically similarly to how you interact with `WorkItemModule`.
This structure will help prevent errors related to injection contexts and allow dynamic loading of components and modules as intended.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":12032,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3801,""usageInWh"":2.3735}","08f80942-6a46-45ee-96c9-53e9a93c0dd8","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-25T06:04:30.5897106Z","rdhqALeKrF7SAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7SAAAAAAAAAA==/","""4401e5bc-0000-1600-0000-685b917d0000""","attachments/","1750831485"

   You would need to modify your component (`<app-dropdown-menu>`) to accept projected content rather than relying solely on a template reference input.
   ```typescript
   // dropdown-menu.component.ts
   import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';
   @Component({
     selector: 'app-dropdown-menu',
     template: `
       <div class=""dropdown"">
         <button class=""dropdown-toggle"">{{ title }}</button>
         <div class=""dropdown-menu"">
           <ng-container *ngFor=""let item of rowItems"">
             <ng-content select=""[rowItemTemplate]""></ng-content>
           </ng-container>
         </div>
       </div>
     `
   })
   export class DropdownMenuComponent {
     @Input() title: string;
     @Input() rowItems: any[];
   }
   ```
2. **Use in Parent Component:**
   When using the `<app-dropdown-menu>`, you can insert your template directly into the component's content.
   ```html
   <app-dropdown-menu [title]=""menuTitle"" [rowItems]=""pets"">
     <ng-template ngProjectAs=""[rowItemTemplate]"" let-pet>
       <span>{{ pet.name | titlecase }}</span>
     </ng-template>
   </app-dropdown-menu>
- **`ngProjectAs` Attribute:** You can use `ngProjectAs` to project specific content into a place expected by `ng-content` in the child component. This attribute essentially provides an alias to match child content to parent projections.
- **`ng-content`:** This allows the content to be projected into specific parts of a template, which in this case is determined by the `[rowItemTemplate]` attribute selector to align with the `ng-container` inside the component.
### Note:
This setup requires that the component correctly utilizes `ng-content` to manage the template content projection. You need to ensure no syntax errors exist in the usage and that Angular recognizes `ngProjectAs` properly in the relevant versions. This solution allows you to have the template logic handled directly within Angular's projection without passing a template reference directly as an input property.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":78,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2574,""usageInWh"":1.356}","bb9fa093-66e8-4d4c-9a39-ee585e633dd5","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-25T07:09:13.7691138Z","rdhqALeKrF7TAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7TAAAAAAAAAA==/","""46017ca1-0000-1600-0000-685ba0c40000""","attachments/","1750835396"

In that scenario, each `ng-template` content projection would not automatically have access to the component's variables, such as `pet`, unless explicitly passed and handled.
To properly bind data to a template projected using `ng-content`, you need to pass the data explicitly in the context where the `ng-content` gets processed. The `ngProjectAs` attribute is mainly useful for CSS-style projection using selectors and doesn't provide direct support for data binding.
Unfortunately, `ng-content` does not support binding variables directly like `<ng-template>`. Therefore, you must use different means to bind dynamic data like `let-pet` to each template instance.
### Revised Approach
Given the restrictions, it might be better to refactor the `<app-dropdown-menu>` component to specifically handle templates with inputs. The typical approach involves using `<ng-template>` with `TemplateRef` and `ng-container` for dynamically applying the template:
1. **Modify the Child Component:**
   Use the `TemplateRef` input property to apply the template, allowing the component to control the context in which the template is used.
   import { Component, Input, TemplateRef } from '@angular/core';
             <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet=""rowItemTemplate; context: {$implicit: item}""></ng-container>
     @Input() rowItemTemplate: TemplateRef<any>;
2. **Use in the Parent Component:**
   Pass the template to the child using `ng-template` and refer to it with `TemplateRef`.
   <app-dropdown-menu [title]=""menuTitle"" [rowItems]=""pets"" [rowItemTemplate]=""petTemplate"">
   <ng-template #petTemplate let-pet>
     <span>{{ pet.name | titlecase }}</span>
   </ng-template>
### What Happens Here:
- **TemplateRef Usage:** The `rowItemTemplate` input accepts a `TemplateRef`. It's used in a `ngTemplateOutlet` directive to render the template for each item in `rowItems`.
- **Context Passing:** The `ngTemplateOutlet` uses a context object which injects `item` into the template as `$implicit`. This allows you to access the `pet` variable as designed, enabling `pet.name` to function as expected.
This setup supports dynamic content rendering while maintaining the ability to pass arbitrary templates with local variables to your component.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":621,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2878,""usageInWh"":1.60335}","a04e47ec-bcb3-435e-bd51-70dc0a1c0329","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-25T07:10:51.7050698Z","rdhqALeKrF7UAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7UAAAAAAAAAA==/","""4601f8a9-0000-1600-0000-685ba10a0000""","attachments/","1750835466"

2. **Eingeschränkte Funktionen:** Manche Funktionen oder Features werden im Energiesparmodus deaktiviert oder eingeschränkt, was die Nutzung weniger komfortabel macht.
3. **Verlangsamte Reaktionszeiten:** Das System kann länger brauchen, um zu reagieren, da es darauf ausgelegt ist, Energie zu sparen, und nicht die maximale Geschwindigkeit oder Reaktionsfähigkeit zu bieten.
4. **Vermeintliche Leistungsbegrenzung:** Für bestimmte Anwendungen, wie z.B. beim Laptop, kann die Akkulaufzeit verlängert werden, aber die Gesamtleistung wird vermindert, was bei anspruchsvoller Nutzung störend sein kann.
5. **Potenzielle Beeinträchtigung der Benutzererfahrung:** Wenn der Energiesparmodus zu aggressiv eingestellt ist, können beispielsweise Bildschärfe, Helligkeit oder Soundqualität eingeschränkt werden.
6. **Kurzfristige Einsparungen, langfristige Einschränkungen:** Obwohl der Energiesparmodus Energie spart, kann eine längere Nutzung dazu führen, dass bestimmte Aufgaben langsamer erledigt werden, was bei bestimmten Anwendungen zeitaufwändig sein kann.

Bei Wix kann es manchmal vorkommen, dass bestimmte Elemente, wie Vektors, an Rasterlinien, Ankerpunkten oder ""Magneten"" ausgerichtet sind, was das Feinjustieren erschwert. Hier sind einige Tipps, um das Problem zu lösen:
1. **Ausrichtungssperren deaktivieren:**  
   - Klicke auf das Element, bei dem das Magnetverhalten auftritt.  
   - Oben in der Toolbar sollte eine Option wie „Ausrichtung an Raster“ oder „Magnet aktiv“ (meist als Magnet-Symbol dargestellt) sichtbar sein.  
   - Diese Option kannst du deaktivieren, um das Element frei zu drehen, ohne an Raster oder Ankerpunkte zu haften.
2. **Raster- und Ausrichtungsoptionen ausschalten:**  
   - Gehe auf „Einstellungen“ > „Raster & Linien“ oder „Gitter“ in der linken Sidebar.  
   - Deaktiviere „Raster auf Maskierung“ oder „Ausrichten am Raster“, falls aktiviert.
3. **Feinjustierung im Rotations-Panel:**  
   - Wenn du das Element auswählst, kannst du im Eigenschaftenfenster die Drehung präzise einstellen, z.B. im Rotationsfeld die Gradzahl manuell eingeben (z.B. 3 Grad).  
   - So kannst du das Element exakt in der gewünschten Position drehen, ohne dass es springt.
4. **Freie Rotation versuchen:**  
   - Wenn die Drehung nur über das Ziehen an der Ecke des Elements funktioniert, halte die Shift-Taste gedrückt, während du drehst. Das kann manchmal die Magnetfunktion umgehen.
5. **Zoom-Faktor verändern:**  
   - Manchmal hilft es, den Zoomfaktor in Wix zu erhöhen, um feinere Ausrichtung zu ermöglichen.
**Kurzfassung:**  
Schalte die Magnet- bzw. Rasterfunktion aus, indem du das Magnet-Symbol in der Toolbar deaktivierst, oder in den Raster- und Hilfslinieneinstellungen. Danach kannst du das Element präziser drehen.

In Wix kann es manchmal tatsächlich sein, dass bestimmte Funktionen wie Magneten oder Anker eine Feineinstellung beim Drehen erschweren, und die üblichen Einstellungen sind nicht immer intuitiv sichtbar. Hier sind einige weitere Tipps, die dir helfen könnten:
1. **Rotation mit dem Einstellungsfenster:**
   - Wähle das Vector-Element aus.
   - Klicke in der Eigenschaftenleiste auf das Rotationssymbol oder das Drehwerkzeug.
   - Gib dort manuell die gewünschte Gradzahl ein (z.B. 3°). Das umgeht das Ziehen und mögliche „Springen“.
2. **Verwende das Tastatur-Feintuning:**
   - Wenn du das Element auswählst, kannst du in einigen Wix-Editoren mit den Pfeiltasten (bei gedrückter Shift-Taste) die Rotation feiner einstellen.
   - Ansonsten kannst du beim Eingeben eine Dezimalstelle verwenden, z.B. 3,0°, um eine genauere Einstellung zu erhalten.
3. **Raster- und Linealeinstellungen:**
   - Auch wenn du sagst, diese sind nicht sichtbar, versuche mal, in den Editor-Einstellungen oder im Menü „Ansicht“ nach „Lineale“ oder „Hilfslinien“ zu suchen und diese auszuschalten, um das Element frei zu drehen.
4. **Layout- und Anker-Eigenschaften überprüfen:**
   - Manchmal sind Vektoren in Wix als „inline“ oder „fest geparkt“ eingestellt, was das Rotieren beeinflusst. Stelle sicher, dass sie auf „frei“ oder „positioniert“ stehen und nicht an einem Ankerpunkt hängen.
5. **Vektorelemente neu erstellen:**
   - Falls nichts hilft, könntest du versuchen, das Vector-Element zu löschen und neu zu erstellen, ggf. in einer neuen Ebene, um das Magnetverhalten zu umgehen.
Wenn das Problem weiterhin besteht, kannst du auch einen Blick in den Wix-Support werfen oder einen Screenshot schicken, damit ich dir gezielter weiterhelfen kann.

Shift-Taste zum exakten Drehen) für das Rotieren von Elementen direkt im Editor. Allerdings kannst du einige Methoden verwenden, um die Rotation präziser durchzuführen:
**Möglichkeiten für präziseres Drehen in Wix:**
1. **Manuelle Eingabe des Rotationswinkels:**
   - Wähle das Vector- oder anderes Element aus.
   - Gehe in die Eigenschaften (Eigenschaftsfenster).
   - Dort kannst du in das Rotationsfeld eine genaue Gradzahl eingeben, z.B. `3`, `3.0`, `-3` usw.
   - Das ermöglicht eine exakte Rotation ohne Magnete.
2. **Raster und Hilfslinien aktivieren/deaktivieren:**
   - Über das Menü „Ansicht“ kannst du Raster, Hilfslinien und Magnetfunktion aktivieren/deaktivieren.
   - Das erleichtert das präzise Platzieren und Drehen.
3. **Tastatureingaben bei der Rotation:**
   - Bisher ist bekannt, dass Wix keine Tastenkürzel wie Shift für das restriktive Drehen (z.B. in 15° Schritten) bietet.
   - Man kann allerdings beim Rotieren mit der Maus versuchen, die linke Maustaste gedrückt zu halten und die Shift-Taste zu verwenden, um das Drehen auf bestimmte Achsen zu beschränken — allerdings ist das oft weniger präzise als die manuelle Eingabe.
4. **Verwendung von Diagramm-Tools (z.B. in Editor X):**
   - In Editor X gibt es erweiterte Steuerungsmöglichkeiten, aber in klassischem Wix-Editor eher weniger.
Es gibt kein direktes Tastenkürzel wie Shift, um in Wix beim Drehen zu „snap“ (einrasten) oder auf exakte Winkel zu springen. Die präziseste Methode ist immer noch, die Drehung per Eingabefeld festzulegen.
Wenn du regelmäßig präzise Drehungen machen musst, empfehle ich, die Rotation im Eigenschaftenfenster genau einzugeben.

Es tut mir leid, dass die genannten Möglichkeiten nicht wie beschrieben funktionieren. In Wix gibt es in der Tat keine standardmäßigen Tastenkürzel wie Shift, um beim Drehen von Elementen im Editor die Rotation auf bestimmte Winkel oder in Schritten zu beschränken.
**Aktuelle Situation in Wix:**
- Beim Ziehen und Drehen eines Elements mit der Maus kannst du versuchen, die Shift-Taste zu verwenden, um das Element zu arretieren. Allerdings unterstützt Wix diese Funktion nicht standardmäßig.
- Das rotieren per manuelle Eingabe ist möglich, aber eine Rotation beim Ziehen wird nicht durch Tastenkombinationen beeinflusst.
**Was du tun kannst:**
- **Rotation anhand der Eigenschaften manuell eingeben:** Das ist die einzige zuverlässige Methode, um eine exakte Rotation zu erreichen.
- **Ausrichtung per Raster:** Aktiviere Rasterlinien und Magnetfunktion in den Ansichtsoptionen, um Elemente präzise auszurichten, auch beim Drehen.
- **Externe Tools:** Falls du regelmäßig sehr präzise Rotation benötigst, könnte es sinnvoll sein, Grafiken in einem Programm wie Photoshop vorzubereiten und fertig ausgerichtet in Wix hochzuladen.
Bis heute gibt es in Wix keinen Shortcut, der die Rotation beim Element mit Shift oder anderen Tasten einschränkt oder anpasst.

### 2. **Platzierung auf der Startseite**
- **Obere Drittel:** Platziere die Frage im oberen Bereich der Startseite, z.B. im hero-Abschnitt (Anschnitt „Header“ oder „Hero Section“), damit sie sofort sichtbar ist.
- **Zentrierung:** Zentriere die Frage auf der Seite, um den Fokus darauf zu lenken.
### 3. **Verwendung eines speziellen Elements**
- **Box oder Banner:** Stelle die Frage in eine auffällige Box oder ein Banner mit einer Farbe, die vom Rest abhebt.
- **Icons oder visuelle Elemente:** Ergänze die Frage durch passende Icons, z.B. eine Sprechblase, Fragezeichen oder eine farbige Lichtlinie.
### 4. **Textgestaltung und -formulierung**
- **Klare, prägnante Formulierung:** Stelle die Frage als direkten, ansprechenden Satz dar, z.B.:
  - „Bibel-Treff Rothrist – Sind Sie neugierig?“
  - „Wollen Sie mehr über den Bibel-Treff Rothrist erfahren?“
  - Oder noch einfacher: „Bibel-Treff Rothrist? – Finden Sie hier die Antwort.“
### 5. **Interaktive Elemente**
- **Button oder Link:** Ergänze einen auffälligen Button „Mehr erfahren“ oder „Besuchen Sie uns“, der direkt unter der Frage platziert ist, um die Besucher zum Handeln zu bewegen.
- **Hover-Effekte:** Nutze Hover-Effekte, die beim Überfahren mit der Maus die Frage hervorheben.
### Umsetzung in Wix
In Wix kannst du diese Tipps folgendermaßen umsetzen:
1. **Abschnitt hinzufügen:** Füge im Editor einen „Hero“-Abschnitt oder einen Abschnitt mit Vollbild-Hintergrund hinzu.
2. **Text hinzufügen:** Ziehe ein Text-Element in den Bereich und schreibe deine Frage.
3. **Design anpassen:** Ändere Schriftgröße, Schriftart, Farbe und Ausrichtung im Text-Editor.
4. **Hintergrund oder Box:** Füge bei Bedarf eine farbige Box hinter den Text hinzu (über „Hintergrund“ oder als dekoratives Element).
5. **Animation einfügen:** Wähle das Text-Element aus, klicke auf „Animationen“ und wähle eine passende Animation.
6. **Buttons ergänzen:** Füge einen Button hinzu, gestalte ihn auffällig und platziere ihn passend.

Allerdings ist ""L-QIFs"" nicht eine standardisierte Abkürzung in der Branche, weshalb es auch eine spezifische oder technische Bedeutung haben könnte.
Mögliche Interpretation:
- **L-QIFs (Limited-Qualification Investment Funds):**  
  Dies könnten spezielle Fonds sein, die nur bestimmte anlegerbezogene Qualifikationen erfüllen müssen, beispielsweise nur für professionelle oder qualifizierte Anleger zugänglich sind. Dabei kann es um regulatorische Anforderungen und Anlagegrenzen gehen.
- **L-QIFs im Zusammenhang mit Liquidität:**  
  Das ""L"" könnte auch für ""Liquiditäts-"" oder ""Leverage-""bezogene Kriterien stehen, wobei der Fonds spezielle Anforderungen an Liquidität oder Verschuldung aufweist.
### Zusammenfassung im Asset Management:
**L-QIFs** sind möglicherweise **ein spezieller Fonds-Typ**, der durch regulatorische oder strategische Merkmale gekennzeichnet ist, z.B.:
- Erfüllung bestimmter Qualifikationskriterien für Investoren
- Gezielte Anlagepolitik mit Fokus auf Liquidität oder Risikomanagement
- Spezielle rechtliche oder steuerliche Rahmenbedingungen
### Empfehlung:
Da ""L-QIFs"" kein allgemein gebräuchlicher Begriff sind, empfehle ich, die Quelle oder den Kontext, in dem du auf diesen Begriff gestoßen bist, noch einmal zu prüfen.

The primary issue here seems to be with how `switchMap` is being used. The `switchMap` expects a single observable to be returned, but it looks like you are trying to combine two. You should probably use `forkJoin`, `combineLatest`, or another operator to handle multiple observables. Here's a revised version of your code:
  pipe(
    debounceTime(250),
    tap(() => setLoading(true)),
    switchMap(id =>
      combineLatest([
        dataPointService.getBayLiveMeasurementsForSchemaByNodeId({ nodeId: id }).pipe(
          tapResponse({
            next: liveMeasurements => setMeasurements(liveMeasurements),

        topologyService.getSchema({ id: id }).pipe(
            next: setDateil,
      ])
    )
  )
)
- **`combineLatest`:** This operator is used to combine multiple observables. It waits for all sources to emit at least one value and then emits the latest values from each source whenever any of them emits.
- **`tapResponse`:** This seems like a custom operator that you're using to handle the response in both success and error scenarios. Make sure it's correctly implemented to handle both observable outputs in the revised logic.
This revision assumes that both service calls in `switchMap` should happen in parallel and that you want to handle their responses simultaneously. Adjust `combineLatest` to another operator like `forkJoin` or `mergeMap` if your use case is different.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":120,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1743,""usageInWh"":0.93933}","c04e5335-bdc1-45c9-8892-7df7127c8930","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-25T10:59:01.6041094Z","rdhqALeKrF7lAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7lAAAAAAAAAA==/","""5301df98-0000-1600-0000-685c0b6c0000""","attachments/","1750862700"

Hier sind mögliche Gründe, warum dein gewünschtes Bild nicht als Thumbnail angezeigt wird:
1. **LinkedIn unterstützt keine manuelle Thumbnail-Auswahl für Videos:**  
   Im Gegensatz zu Plattformen wie YouTube gibt LinkedIn bei der Video-Upload-Option nur begrenzte Möglichkeiten, ein individuelles Thumbnail auszuwählen. Oft wird automatisch das erste Frame des Videos als Vorschau gezeigt.
2. **Vorschaubild beim Video-Upload ist nur bei bestimmten Formaten verfügbar:**  
   Manchmal kann man beim Hochladen eines Videos eine separate Bilddatei hochladen, die als Vorschau angezeigt wird. Falls du das gemacht hast, ist es möglich, dass LinkedIn dieses Bild nicht als Thumbnail übernimmt, sondern das Video-Frame.
3. **Automatische Vorschau im Algorithmus priorisiert:**  
   LinkedIn kann für die Vorschau automatische Frames auswählen, die für den Algorithmus am attraktivsten sind, auch wenn du ein anderes Bild hochgeladen hast.
4. **Fehlende Synchronisation zwischen Upload-Tools und LinkedIn:**  
   Falls du externe Tools (z. B. Social Media Manager, Video-Editoren) benutzt hast, um das Video mit einem Thumbnail zu versehen, wird dies möglicherweise nicht von LinkedIn unterstützt.
**Was kannst du tun?**  
- **Testweise das Video neu hochladen:** Versuche, das Video ohne zusätzliche Bilder hochzuladen und prüfe, ob LinkedIn das erste Frame verwendet.  
- **Druck auf das Thumbnail durch obenstehendes Bild:** Falls du bei einer Videoanzeige eine Vorschau im Feed möchtest, kannst du nach dem Hochladen im Beitrag noch versuchen, den Vorschaubereifen zu ändern (falls diese Funktion bei deinem Post möglich ist).  
- **Verwende Plattformen wie YouTube oder Vimeo:** Wenn du das Video vorab auf eine Plattform mit mehr Kontrolle über Thumbnails hochlädst und dann den Link teilst, kannst du ein benutzerdefiniertes Thumbnail auswählen.
**Kurz gesagt:**  
LinkedIn übernimmt in der Regel das erste Frame des Videos als Vorschau, wenn kein individuelles Thumbnail festgelegt wurde. Das Setzen eines separaten Vorschaubildes beim Hochladen ist oftmals nicht ausreichend, um dieses als Thumbnail zu verwenden.
Wenn du weiterhin eine spezifische Vorschau möchtest, ist der **beste Weg**, das Video auf einer Plattform mit genauer Thumbnail-Option hochzuladen und dann den Link auf LinkedIn zu teilen.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":174,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2608,""usageInWh"":0.58486}","d118890b-64f2-4536-8d8a-13173eeb98af","de3e3163a6e04819a87f34df897f78aa","2025-06-25T11:58:44.8969732Z","rdhqALeKrF7oAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7oAAAAAAAAAA==/","""4e01aaf9-0000-1600-0000-685be4a70000""","attachments/","1750852775"

### Gründe, warum ein anderes Frame als Vorschau angezeigt wird:
1. **Automatische Vorschau-Auswahl durch LinkedIn**:  
   LinkedIn wählt für die Video-Vorschau oft automatisch das Frame, das sie für am ansprechendsten halten – also ein Frame, das am besten zur Aufmerksamkeit passt. Es ist also nicht immer das erste Frame, das angezeigt wird, selbst wenn du ein anderes Bild hochgeladen hast.
2. **Eingeschränkte Steuerung beim Hochladen**:  
   Im Gegensatz zu Plattformen wie YouTube oder Vimeo unterstützt LinkedIn meist keine direkte Auswahl des Thumbnails beim Video-Upload. Das Bild, das du hochlädst, wird möglicherweise nur für andere Zwecke (z. B. Vorschau im Beitrag) verwendet, nicht aber für das Vorschaubild des Videos im Feed.
3. **Verarbeitung durch LinkedIn nach Upload**:  
   Nach dem Hochladen verarbeitet LinkedIn das Video, um eine Vorschau zu generieren. Dabei kann das System automatisch das Frame auswählen, das am prominentesten erscheint – oft das zweite oder dritte Frame, wenn es ""besser"" für die Vorschau erscheint.
4. **Bild- und Video-Frames unterscheiden sich**:  
   Wenn du das erste Frame des Videos durch ein Vorschaubild ersetzt hast, ist das nur innerhalb des Videos sichtbar. LinkedIn kann trotzdem auf das gleiche oder ein anderes Frame im Video zurückgreifen, um das Vorschau-Thumbnail zu generieren, wenn keine explizite manuelle Auswahl erfolgt.
### Was kannst du tun, um das gewünschte Vorschaubild zu gewährleisten?
- **Sicherstellen, dass das gewünschte Bild im Video an erster Stelle steht**:  
  Stelle sicher, dass das Bild, das du als Vorschaubild willst, im Video an erster Position ist. Wenn du es nur per Bilddatei hochgeladen hast, aber es nicht im Video integriert ist, übernimmt LinkedIn wahrscheinlich das erste Frame des eigentlichen Videos.
- **Video vor dem Hochladen entsprechend anpassen**:  
  Bearbeite dein Video so, dass dein spannendes Vorschaubild im ersten Frame enthalten ist, bevor du es hochlädst.
- **Manuelle Thumbnail-Auswahl bei anderen Plattformen**:  
  Nutze Plattformen, die eine direkte Auswahl des Thumbnails erlauben, und teile dann den Link (z. B. YouTube) auf LinkedIn.
- **Screenshot des gewünschten Frames hochladen** (wenn Plattform diese Option zulässt):  
  Manche Nutzer laden ein ""Vorschaubild"" separat hoch, um im Feed eine andere Vorschau anzuzeigen, aber diese wird oft nur bei Beiträgen, nicht bei Video-Posts übernommen.
### Fazit:
LinkedIn wählt selbst das Vorschau-Frame, meist das erste oder andere ""attraktivere"" Frame, basierend auf einer automatischen Auswahl. Das Hochladen eines Bildes in der Hoffnung, dass es als Vorschau genutzt wird, funktioniert oft nicht, weil das System das Video selbst für Vorschauen aussucht.
**Tipp:** Um sicherzugehen, dass dein gewünschtes Bild angezeigt wird, integriere es ins Video an erster Stelle, bevor du es hochlädst.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":650,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3119,""usageInWh"":0.72549}","0c0001ba-54c5-444e-8f67-3fcbec68cc5d","de3e3163a6e04819a87f34df897f78aa","2025-06-25T12:04:30.6729114Z","rdhqALeKrF7pAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7pAAAAAAAAAA==/","""4f01d821-0000-1600-0000-685be5d70000""","attachments/","1750853079"

","1","gpt-4o-mini","5","true","2025-06-25T12:29:19.500311Z","To implement the `ngOnDestroy` lifecycle method in your `EntityPreviewComponent`, we need to clean up any resources that were allocated during the component's lifecycle. Typically, this includes:
1. **Destroying any dynamically created components** to prevent memory leaks.
2. **Cleaning up any subscriptions** (if applicable).
3. **De-referencing/clearing any references** to objects or modules that won’t be used anymore.
In your case, since you're dynamically creating a component using `ViewContainerRef`, we should ensure that any created components are destroyed when the `EntityPreviewComponent` is destroyed.
Here’s how you can implement `ngOnDestroy` to clean up your component:
### Implementation of `ngOnDestroy`
ngOnDestroy(): void {
    console.log('EntityPreviewComponent destroyed');
    // Clear the ViewContainerRef if there are child components created
    if (this.entityTemplate) {
        this.entityTemplate.clear(); // This will destroy any components in the view container
    // Additional cleanup (if you had subscriptions, etc.):
    // if (this.someSubscription) {
    //     this.someSubscription.unsubscribe();
    // }
    // Nullify references for garbage collection
    this.entityComponent = null;
    this.moduleRef = null; 
    this.childInjector = null; 
### Key Points for Cleanup
1. **Clear the ViewContainerRef**:
   - The call to `this.entityTemplate.clear()` will destroy all components that were created within that `ViewContainerRef`, which is important for preventing memory leaks.
2. **Clear References**:
   - Setting `this.entityComponent`, `this.moduleRef`, and `this.childInjector` to `null` helps clear references. This is useful if your component has strong references that could prevent garbage collection. Although in most cases, clearing the container will suffice, it's a good practice to reset used properties.
3. **Unsubscribe from Services (if needed)**:
   - If you have any observables or services where subscriptions were made, be sure to properly unsubscribe from them to prevent any potential leaks. I have included commented code to illustrate this point.
### Example Cleaned-Up Component
Here’s the complete example with `ngOnDestroy` implemented:
    styleUrls: ['./entity-preview.component.scss'],
    moduleRef: NgModuleRef<any> | null = null;
    childInjector: Injector | null = null;
    injector = inject(EnvironmentInjector);
            // Load modules and components based on inbound entityType...
        // Clear the ViewContainerRef if there are child components created
        if (this.entityTemplate) {
            this.entityTemplate.clear(); // This will destroy any components in the view container
        // Cleanup references
        this.entityComponent = null;
        this.moduleRef = null; 
        this.childInjector = null; 
By adding the `ngOnDestroy` method, you'll ensure that your component cleans up any dynamically created resources properly when it is destroyed, which helps maintain optimal performance and prevents memory leaks in your Angular application.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":4416,""numberOfOutputTokens"":4827,""usageInWh"":1.9197}","db8ccc27-6ff1-43a5-a9a9-6a3f4c2272c5","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-25T12:29:06.091091Z","rdhqALeKrF7qAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7qAAAAAAAAAA==/","""4f0182d6-0000-1600-0000-685bebac0000""","attachments/","1750854572"

whats the issue?","2","gpt-4o","10","true","2025-06-25T12:58:14.7128128Z","The error message indicates that a unit test is expecting a specific method call (`SendAsync`) to be made exactly once with certain parameters, but this call is either not happening or not matching the expected parameters.
Here's a breakdown of the issue:
1. **Expected Call Specification**: The test expects a call to `SendAsync` with a parameter (likely an object or DTO) that matches a specific set of conditions:
   - `InitiatorRole` should be ""Advisor""
   - `IsCollectiveSignatory` should be true
   - `PartnerNumber` should be ""123456""
   - `ContactTypeId` should be 8
   - `ContactDateTime` should match a specific datetime
   - Other properties (`ContactPhoneNumber`, `Subject`, `Notes`, `BankRepresentatives`, `SubmittedBy`, `SubmittedOn`, `MeetingLocation`) all have specific expected values.
2. **Actual Call**: The error message states that there was one non-matching call to `SendAsync` with an argument marked with a wildcard (`*`), indicating that it doesn't match what was expected. The received call passed a `SendMultipleContactNotesRequestDto` object, implying there might be a mismatch in the expected object type or properties.
3. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Mismatch in DTO/Object Type**: The object passed might not match the expected type or structure. It appears `SendAsync` received a `SendMultipleContactNotesRequestDto` instead of whatever the test expected (possibly a different DTO or specific property values).
   - **Incorrect Parameter Values**: Double-check the values being set in your DTO before calling `SendAsync`. Ensure they match the expected values in the test.
   - **Call Not Made**: Ensure that the method call is actually being made in your production code under the conditions of your test. There might be logic preventing it from running.
To resolve this issue:
- Review the code within `CreateContactNoteCommandHandlerTest` to ensure you are setting up the DTO with the expected properties.
- Confirm that the conditions lead to the `SendAsync` method execution.
- Evaluate the mock setup to ensure any dependencies are correctly configured.
Debugging this may also involve placing breakpoints or log statements to inspect the actual parameters being passed to `SendAsync` during the test's execution.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":489,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2260,""usageInWh"":1.26573}","4f94b210-80e2-4783-ba2d-d602574eb053","e6c6fdc37f5247779986718dd20d086e","2025-06-25T12:58:04.3514025Z","rdhqALeKrF7rAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7rAAAAAAAAAA==/","""50015aa6-0000-1600-0000-685bf2730000""","attachments/","1750856307"

However, you can work around this limitation by creating a method in your component class that performs these checks, which you can then call from the template.
### Step 1: Define Your Enum
First, let's assume you have an enum defined for your page states. Here's an example:
export enum PageStates {
    LoadedWorkItem = 1 << 0, // 1
    LoadedAppointment = 1 << 1, // 2
    LoadedFile = 1 << 2, // 4
    LoadedUser = 1 << 3, // 8
    LoadedTeam = 1 << 4, // 16
    LoadedMeeting = 1 << 5, // 32
    LoadedDataObject = 1 << 6, // 64
    LoadedJob = 1 << 7, // 128
    LoadedConversation = 1 << 8, // 256
    LoadedTimeRecord = 1 << 9 // 512
### Step 2: Create a Method to Perform the Bitwise Check
Next, create a method in your Angular component that takes the current state and checks if it matches the combined states you're interested in:
import { PageStates } from './your-enum-path'; // Adjust to your actual path
  templateUrl: './your-component.component.html',
  currentState = PageStates.LoadedWorkItem | PageStates.LoadedFile; // Example current state
  // Method to check if current state matches the required combined states
  isCurrentStateValid(): boolean {
    const requiredStates = (
      PageStates.LoadedWorkItem |
      PageStates.LoadedAppointment |
      PageStates.LoadedFile |
      PageStates.LoadedUser |
      PageStates.LoadedTeam |
      PageStates.LoadedMeeting |
      PageStates.LoadedDataObject |
      PageStates.LoadedJob |
      PageStates.LoadedConversation |
      PageStates.LoadedTimeRecord
    );
    return (this.currentState & requiredStates) === this.currentState;
### Step 3: Use the Method in Your Angular Template
You can then use the method in your template to determine whether or not to show certain content:
<div *ngIf=""isCurrentStateValid()"">
  <!-- Your content that should only be shown when the current state matches -->
  <p>The current state includes the loaded work item, appointment, file, or other components.</p>
### Full Example
Putting it all together, here's how your component might look:
    LoadedWorkItem = 1 << 0,
    LoadedAppointment = 1 << 1,
    LoadedFile = 1 << 2,
    LoadedUser = 1 << 3,
    LoadedTeam = 1 << 4,
    LoadedMeeting = 1 << 5,
    LoadedDataObject = 1 << 6,
    LoadedJob = 1 << 7,
    LoadedConversation = 1 << 8,
    LoadedTimeRecord = 1 << 9
### Template Example
And your component’s HTML template might include:
  <!-- Content displayed when currentState is valid -->
  <p>Current state is valid and displayed!</p>
### Conclusion
By creating a method in your component, you simplify using complex bitwise operations in your templates.

This way, you'll have calculated the result once when the state changes, and you can reference the property directly in the template.
### Step 1: Compute the Value in the Component
Instead of defining a method, you can compute the result directly within your component whenever `currentState` changes. You can use a getter to calculate the combined state, which simplifies the logic within your Angular template.
Here is an example of how you can achieve this:
  // Create a getter to compute the valid state
  get isCurrentStateValid(): boolean {
### Step 2: Use the Computed Property in Your Template
You can now leverage this getter directly in your template using property binding:
<div *ngIf=""isCurrentStateValid"">
### How This Works
- **Getter**: The `isCurrentStateValid` getter computes the value based on `currentState`. Since it's a property, you don't explicitly call it like a method, but Angular will access it as if it were a field.
- **Change Detection**: The getter will be recalculated when Angular's change detection runs and when `currentState` is updated, ensuring the template always reflects the current state.
### Full Updated Example
Here’s the complete example with the computed property:
  // Getter to check if the current state is valid
And your component’s HTML template will look like this:
### Final Notes
Using a getter provides a clean and efficient way to evaluate conditions in the template without having to call a method directly. This leverages Angular's change detection capabilities while keeping your template concise and free from unnecessary method calls.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":4838,""numberOfOutputTokens"":4344,""usageInWh"":1.817}","db9a2ed3-4f8f-4d91-b361-13f5d334c0b5","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-25T13:02:38.9820555Z","rdhqALeKrF7tAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7tAAAAAAAAAA==/","""5001b6c9-0000-1600-0000-685bf3880000""","attachments/","1750856584"

This allows Angular to properly check the `outletType` against each case.
### Example Structure
Here's how you can set this up:
<div [ngSwitch]=""outletType""> <!-- Assuming outletType is defined in your component -->
    <app-work-item *ngSwitchCase=""outletTypes.Workitem"" [workItemInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-work-item>
    <app-user-resources *ngSwitchCase=""outletTypes.UserRessources"" [outletInfo]=""outletInfo"" [isDoubleClickEnabled]=""true""></app-user-resources>
    <app-data-object *ngSwitchCase=""outletTypes.DataObject"" [dataObjectInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-data-object>
    <app-time-record-player *ngSwitchCase=""outletTypes.TimeRecordPlayer"" [playerInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-time-record-player>
    <!-- Optional: You can add a default case using ngSwitchDefault -->
    <ng-container *ngSwitchDefault>
        <p>No valid outlet type selected.</p>
1. **`ngSwitch` Directive**: The parent `<div>` element uses the `[ngSwitch]` directive to evaluate `outletType`. This should be a property defined in your component that specifies what type of outlet you are currently working with.
2. **`ngSwitchCase`**: Each `<app-component>` directive utilizes `*ngSwitchCase` to check if `outletType` matches one of the defined `outletTypes`. If it does, the corresponding component will be rendered with the appropriate input bindings.
3. **Inputs**: Each component gets its inputs (like `workItemInfo`, `fileInfo`, etc.) from `outletInfo`, which should also be defined in your component.
4. **Default Case**: The optional `ngSwitchDefault` can be provided to handle situations where none of the cases match, which can be useful for error handling or fallback UI.
### Full Example in the Component
Assuming your component looks something like this:
// Define your outlet types (assuming your enum is set up like this)
export enum OutletTypes {
  Workitem,
  File,
  Meeting,
  User,
  Team,
  TimeRecord,
  Calendar,
  UserRessources,
  DataObject,
  Appointment,
  TimeRecordPlayer,
  outletType: OutletTypes; // This would be set based on your application logic
  outletInfo: any; // This should be your actual data structure
  constructor() {
    // Initialize your outletType and outletInfo here or from an API call
    this.outletType = OutletTypes.Workitem; // Example value
    this.outletInfo = {}; // Fill with actual information
Using `ngSwitch` allows for easy conditional rendering of components in Angular based on a specific property, keeping your templates organized and readable.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":5448,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3729,""usageInWh"":1.6935}","321f9b39-b25b-40d5-847b-7bd65345848b","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-25T13:23:02.6635878Z","rdhqALeKrF7xAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7xAAAAAAAAAA==/","""51010b5e-0000-1600-0000-685bf8500000""","attachments/","1750857808"

This will allow you to check if `outletType` matches any of the values defined in your `outletTypes`.
### Using `*ngIf` with OR Condition
Here's how to implement that. Assuming you want to check if `currentOutletType` matches any of your defined `outletTypes`, you can do it like this:
<ng-container *ngIf=""

    <app-user *ngIf=""currentOutletType === outletTypes.User"" [userInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-user>
    <app-team *ngIf=""currentOutletType === outletTypes.Team"" [teamInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-team>

    <app-data-object *ngIf=""currentOutletType === outletTypes.DataObject"" [dataObjectInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-data-object>
    <app-appointment *ngIf=""currentOutletType === outletTypes.Appointment"" [appointmentInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-appointment>
    <app-time-record-player *ngIf=""currentOutletType === outletTypes.TimeRecordPlayer"" [playerInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-time-record-player>
</ng-container>
<ng-container *ngIf=""!( 
)"">
    <p>No valid outlet type selected.</p>
1. **Using `*ngIf` with Logical OR**:
   - The `*ngIf` directive evaluates if `currentOutletType` matches any of the outlet types. If any condition is true, the container contents will be displayed.
2. **Component Rendering**:
   - Inside the `<ng-container>`, individual components are conditionally rendered by checking if `currentOutletType` matches the corresponding outlet type using additional `*ngIf` directives.
3. **Fallback Message**:
   - The second `<ng-container>` checks the opposite condition. If none of the outlet types match, it displays a fallback message indicating that no valid outlet type is selected.
This approach allows you to treat the presence of multiple options as a single ""true"" condition using an OR (`||`) operator. By combining `*ngIf` in this way, you maintain clear control over what gets rendered based on the current state of `currentOutletType`.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":5544,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3944,""usageInWh"":1.7676}","884bc2ae-0ce4-4686-b526-ce258922fa7f","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-25T13:23:59.5189629Z","rdhqALeKrF7yAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7yAAAAAAAAAA==/","""51017067-0000-1600-0000-685bf89e0000""","attachments/","1750857886"

### 1. **Verwendung einer spezialisierten App für Kalender-Feeds**
#### a) **Wix App „Google Calendar“ oder „Embed Calendars“**
- **Beschreibung:** Diese Apps integrieren den Google Kalender direkt auf deiner Seite, aber oft sind sie eher für die vollständige Kalenderansicht gedacht.
- **Limitierung:** Für ein Banner mit nur den nächsten drei Ereignissen ist diese Lösung meist zu umfangreich.
#### b) **Apps zur Event- oder Kalenderanzeige mit Feed-Filterung**
- Es gibt spezielle Wix-Apps wie:
  - **Wix Events** (für eigene Events, nicht direkt Google Kalender)
  - **powr.io Apps** (z.B. „Powr Calendar“ oder „Powr Inc“)
  - **Elfsight Widgets** – **Event Calendar Widget** oder Ähnliches
**Elfsight** bietet z.B. ein **„Upcoming Events“** Widget, das mit Google Kalender verbunden werden kann, um die nächsten Termine anzuzeigen. Diese Widgets sind sehr flexibel und lassen sich optisch anpassen.
### 2. **Verbindung von Google Kalender zu einem Drittanbieter-Widget (z.B. Elfsight, Widgetbox)**
- **Vorteil:** Diese Dienste lassen sich mit deinem Google Kalender verbinden, dann kannst du die letzten kommenden Termine in einem ansprechenden Banner anzeigen.
- **Beispiel:**  
  - **Elfsight „Upcoming Events“ Widget**  
  - **Funktion:** Zeigt die nächsten Ereignisse an, kannst es individuell gestalten, und es ist mit Google Kalender kompatibel.
**So funktioniert es:**  
- Erstelle das Widget bei Elfsight oder einem anderen Anbieter  
- Verbinde es mit deinem Google Kalender (über API/Anleitungen der App)  
- Integriere den generierten Code in deine Wix-Startseite via HTML-Embed-Element
### 3. **Manuelle Lösung mit automatisierten Skripten (fortgeschritten)**
- Wenn du technische Fähigkeiten hast, kannst du eine **Google Apps Script API** verwenden, um die nächsten drei Ereignisse abzurufen und in einem angepasst gestalteten Banner auf der Startseite anzuzeigen.
- Voraussetzung ist Programmierkenntnis, und du könntest z.B. eine **benutzerdefinierte API** bauen, die die Daten liefert, und in Wix über iFrame/HTML einbinden.
### 4. **Empfohlene Vorgehensweise:**
**Am einfachsten und ohne Programmieraufwand:**
- Nutze eine **Elfsight Events Widget** (kostenpflichtig, aber einfach in der Handhabung)
- Verbinde es mit deinem Google Kalender
- Platziere den Widget-Code im Banner auf der Startseite (über HTML-Frame)
### 5. **Design des Banners:**
- Erstelle im Wix-Editor eine **Box oder einen Bereich** oberhalb des „above the fold“ (also im sichtbaren Bereich beim Laden), z.B. mit Text „Nächste Veranstaltungen“ oder „Was ist als Nächstes?“
- Integriere das Widget direkt in den Bereich, so dass die drei kommenden Ereignisse prominent angezeigt werden.
### Zusammenfassung der besten Lösung:
| Lösung | Vorteile | Nachteile |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Elfsight Upcoming Events** | Einfach, optisch anpassbar, Google Kalender integrierbar | Kostenpflichtig, externe Plattform nötig |
| **Wix eigene Apps** | Einfach, direkt in Wix integrierbar | Mögliche Limitierungen bei nur 3 Ereignissen |
| **Eigene Programmierung (API)** | Vollste Kontrolle | Technisch aufwendig |

### Beispiel: Automatisches Senden von Nachrichten in Teams basierend auf Excel-Daten
#### Voraussetzungen:
- Microsoft 365 Konto mit Zugriff auf Power Automate, Excel Online, und Teams.
- Excel-Datei in OneDrive oder SharePoint, die strukturiert ist (z.B. Spalten für Name, Nachricht, Empfänger, etc.).
### Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitung:
1. **Excel vorbereiten:**
   - Stelle sicher, dass deine Excel-Tabelle in OneDrive oder SharePoint gespeichert ist.
   - Die Tabelle sollte z.B. Spalten wie: `Empfänger`, `Nachricht`, `Datum` usw. enthalten.
2. **Power Automate Flow erstellen:**
   - Gehe zu Power Automate und erstelle einen neuen Flow, z.B. einen **geplanten Flow** (z.B. täglich oder wöchentlich), oder einen **automatischen Flow** bei Änderung der Excel-Tabelle.
3. **Excel Daten abrufen:**
   - Nutze die Aktion **""Excel Online (Business) – Zeilen abrufen""** (oder ""List rows present in a table""), um alle Zeilen deiner Tabelle zu holen.
4. **Für jede Zeile eine Schleife:**
   - Füge eine **""Anwendung für jede""**-Schleife hinzu, um durch alle Zeilen zu iterieren.
5. **Nachricht an Teams senden:**
   - Innerhalb der Schleife kannst du die Aktion **""Nachricht in einem Chat oder Kanal senden""** (Teams Connector) verwenden.
   - Wähle den Ziel-Kanal oder den Chat (falls du direkt an einzelne Personen schicken willst).
   - Verwende die Daten aus der Excel-Tabelle, z.B.:
     - Empfänger (z.B. Name oder Teams-Chat-ID)
     - Nachricht (aus der Excel-Spalte)
### Beispiel-Flow-Layout:
1. **Trigger:** Geplanter Trigger (z.B. täglich um 8 Uhr)
2. **Aktion:** Excel-Daten aus Tabelle lesen
3. **Aktion:** Für jede Zeile in den Excel-Daten
   - **Aktion:** Teams-Nachricht senden (an Kanal oder Benutzer)
     - Nachricht: dynamischer Text, z.B. ""Guten Tag, {Name}! Hier ist deine automatisierte Nachricht.""
### Hinweise:
- Um Nachrichten an einzelne Teammitglieder zu senden, kannst du deren Teams-IDs verwenden, oder den Kanal nutzen.
- Für das Senden an einzelne Personen kannst du auch **""Chat starten""** und dort eine Nachricht schicken, falls direktes Messaging erforderlich ist.
- Stelle sicher, dass deine Excel-Tabelle gut strukturiert ist und die Daten aktuell sind.

Hier bekommst du eine detaillierte Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitung, um einen automatisierten Power Automate-Flow zu erstellen, der Daten aus Excel nutzt, um Nachrichten in Teams zu senden.
# Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitung: Automatisch Nachrichten in Teams basierend auf Excel-Daten senden
## 1. Voraussetzungen prüfen & vorbereiten
- **Excel-Datei:**
  - Speicherort: **OneDrive for Business** oder **SharePoint**
  - Format: Tabelle (`Table`) mit mindestens folgenden Spalten:
    - `Empfänger` (z.B. Name, E-Mail, Teams-Chat-ID)
    - `Nachricht` (Text, der gesendet werden soll)
    - **Optional:** `Datum` oder andere Filterkriterien
- **Power Automate:** Zugriff auf dein Microsoft 365-Konto
## 2. Excel-Tabelle erstellen
- Öffne Excel Online (oder Excel Desktop, dann in OneDrive/SharePoint speichern).
- Erstelle eine Tabelle mit klaren Spaltenüberschriften, z.B.:
| Empfänger       | Nachricht                                         | Datum      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------|
| user1@domain.com| Hallo, hier ist eine automatische Nachricht!    | 2023-10-20 |
| user2@domain.com| Bitte denke daran, deinen Bericht zu senden.    | 2023-10-20 |
- Speichere die Datei in OneDrive oder SharePoint, z.B. unter `/Dokumente/Nachrichten.xlsx`.
## 3. Power Automate Flow erstellen
### Schritt 1: Trigger wählen
- **Geplant:** Täglich, wöchentlich, oder alle X Stunden
  - *Trigger: ""Geplanter Cloud-Flow""*
### Schritt 2: Excel-Daten abrufen
- **Aktion:** ""Excel Online (Business) – Zeilen abrufen""
  - **Standort:** OneDrive oder SharePoint
  - **Datei:** Suche deine Excel-Datei
  - **Tabelle:** Wähle die Tabelle aus
### Schritt 3: Schleife durch alle Zeilen
- Füge eine **""Für jede""**-Aktion hinzu
- **Wert:** `Werte aus ""Zeilen abrufen""` (die List-Outputs)
### Schritt 4: Nachricht an Teams senden
Innerhalb der Schleife:
- **Aktion:** ""Teams – Chatnachricht senden"" oder ""Teams – Kanalnachricht posten""
   **Option 1: Nachricht an einen Kanal senden**
   - **Team:** Wähle dein Team
   - **Kanal:** Wähle den Kanal
   - **Nachricht:** Nutze dynamische Inhalte, z.B.:
     ```
     {Nachricht} (z.B. ""Guten Tag, hier ist eine Nachricht für {Empfänger}"")
   **Option 2: Personal Nachricht an einzelne Benutzer senden**
   - **Empfänger:** Nutze die `Empfänger` Spalte (z.B. E-Mail oder Teams-Chat-ID)
   - **Achtung:** Das direkte Senden an einzelne Personen erfordert, dass du die Teams-Chat-ID hast. Alternativ kannst du einen Chat starten und eine Nachricht schicken.
## 4. Optional: Empfänger dynamisch bestimmen
Wenn du z.B. per E-Mail-Adresse oder Namen arbeitest:
- Du kannst die E-Mail-Adresse in der Spalte `Empfänger` haben.
- Für direkte Nachrichten an einzelne Personen könntest du die **""Chat starten""**-Aktion verwenden, allerdings ist diese manchmal eingeschränkt.
Alternativ:
- Poste Nachrichten in einem Kanal und erwähne die Empfänger mittels `@`-Erwähnungen, falls passend.
## 5. Flow testen und anpassen
- Speichere den Flow.
- Führe einen Testlauf durch.
- Kontrolliere, ob die Nachrichten wie gewünscht in Teams erscheinen.
## **Zusatztipps:**
- **Mehrere Empfänger:** Wenn du Nachrichten an mehrere Personen schicken möchtest, kannst du eine Schleife um die Empfänger machen.
- **Nachricht an mehrere Kanäle:** Du kannst mehrere ""Kanalnachricht senden""-Aktionen hinzufügen.
- **Filtern:** Nutze Bedingungen, um nur bestimmte Zeilen zu verarbeiten (z.B. nach Datum oder Status).
## Zusammenfassung:
- Dein Flow liest Daten aus Excel.
- Für jede Zeile sendet er eine Teams-Nachricht.
- Nachrichten sind dynamisch und können individuell angepasst werden.

Lass uns Schritt 3 genauer betrachten, der das Verarbeiten jeder Zeile in deiner Excel-Datei beschreibt:
## Schritt 3: Schleife durch alle Zeilen
Nachdem du die Excel-Daten abgerufen hast, besteht der nächste Schritt darin, durch jede Zeile dieser Daten zu iterieren. Dies erreichst du durch die Einrichtung einer Schleife, die jede Zeile einzeln verarbeitet und basierend auf den Inhalten dieser Zeilen die entsprechenden Aktionen ausführt.
### So richtest du die Schleife ein:
1. **Aktion hinzufügen: ""Für jede""**
   - **Beschreibung:** Diese Aktion hilft dir dabei, durch jede Zeile (jeden Datensatz) in deinem abgerufenen Excel-Datenbestand zu iterieren.
   - **Wert:** Gib hier die Output-Variable aus der vorherigen Excel-Datenabfrage an. Zum Beispiel, falls du ""Zeilen abrufen"" als Aktion gewählt hast, wähle das Ergebnis dieser Aktion aus (oft bezeichnet als `value`).
2. **Innerhalb der ""Für jede""-Schleife:**
   - Hier kannst du die Informationen der aktuellen Zeile verwenden, um die nächste Aktion zu definieren. In diesem Fall möchtest du eine Nachricht in Teams senden, basierend auf den Daten in der jeweiligen Zeile (z.B. Spalten wie `Empfänger`, `Nachricht`, etc.).
----
Dank der ""Für jede"" Schleife wird gewährleistet, dass jede Zeile in deiner Excel-Tabelle berücksichtigt wird, was bedeutet, dass du individuell auf die Bedürfnisse und Nachrichten jedes Empfängers eingehen kannst, der in der Excel-Tabelle aufgeführt ist.

Du kannst einen Flow einrichten, der automatisch ausgelöst wird, sobald eine Excel-Datei an einem bestimmten Ort gespeichert wird. Dazu verwendest du einen Trigger, der auf neue Dateien in einem Ordner in OneDrive for Business oder SharePoint reagiert. Hier ist, wie du das einrichten kannst:
### Vorbereitungen:
- Stelle sicher, dass die Excel-Datei in einem überwachten Ordner in **OneDrive for Business** oder **SharePoint** gespeichert wird.
- Die erforderlichen Berechtigungen für Power Automate auf die entsprechenden Speicherorte (OneDrive/SharePoint).
### Schritt-für-Schritt Anleitung:
1. **Neuen Flow in Power Automate erstellen:**
   - Logge dich in Power Automate ein und klicke auf „Erstellen“.
   - Wähle „Automatisierten Cloud-Flow“ aus.
2. **Trigger auswählen:**
   - Suche nach dem Trigger „Wenn eine Datei erstellt wird“.
   - Wähle den entsprechenden Trigger basierend auf dem Speicherort:
      - **Für OneDrive for Business:** „OneDrive for Business - Wenn eine Datei erstellt wird“
      - **Für SharePoint:** „SharePoint - Wenn eine Datei in einem Ordner erstellt wird“
3. **Trigger konfigurieren:**
   - **Lage:** Wähle den Speicherort aus (OneDrive oder die SharePoint-Seite).
   - **Ordner:** Wähle den spezifischen Ordner aus, den du überwachen möchtest. Dieser Ordner ist der Ort, an dem du die Excel-Dateien speichern wirst, damit der Flow ausgelöst wird.
4. **Aktion festlegen:**
   - Nachdem der Trigger ausgelöst wird (wenn eine Datei im angegebenen Ordner erstellt wird), kannst du Aktionen hinzufügen, die auf die Datei zugreifen und mit ihr interagieren.
   - **Beispielaktion:** Falls du die Inhalte der Excel-Datei weiter verarbeiten möchtest, füge die Aktion „Excel Online (Business) - Tabelle abfragen“ hinzu, um die Tabellen in der Datei zu durchsuchen.
5. **Zusätzliche Logik:**
   - Du kannst Bedingungen oder weitere Schritte hinzufügen, um sicherzustellen, dass nur spezifische Dateien oder Daten in der Datei verarbeitet werden.
   - Hier könntest du z.B. überprüfen, ob es sich bei der Datei um die erwartete Datei handelt oder ob sie den richtigen Namen/das richtige Format hat.
6. **Flow testen:**
   - Speichere den Flow und lade eine Excel-Datei in den überwachten Ordner hoch, um den automatischen Ablauf zu testen.
### Zusammenfassung:
Dieser auslösende Flow beobachtet einen bestimmten Ordner und führt alle konfigurierten Aktionen automatisch aus, wenn eine neue Datei dort abgelegt wird. Dies ist perfekt, um Routineaufgaben zu automatisieren oder Daten sofort zu verarbeiten, sobald sie eingereicht werden.

Erinnerungen zu setzen, falls keine Antwort auf eine manuell gesendete E-Mail eingegangen ist. Jedoch benötigt dieser spezielle Anwendungsfall einige Überlegungen und Workarounds, da Power Automate standardmäßig nicht direkt die Überwachung von erhaltenen Antworten auf gesendete E-Mails unterstützt.
### Mögliche Lösung:
### Voraussetzungen:
- Zugriff auf Power Automate und Outlook (vorausgesetzt, du verwendest Outlook oder Office 365 für E-Mails).
- Ein Organisatorischer/digitaler Weg, um gesendete E-Mails zu verfolgen (z.B. mithilfe von Kategorien, Markierungen oder spezifischen Ordnern).
1. **E-Mail-Tracking einrichten:**
   - Du kannst individuelle gesendete E-Mails in Outlook kategorisieren oder kennzeichnen. In diesem Beispiel könnten wir eine spezielle Kategorie wie „Erinnerung erforderlich“ verwenden.
2. **Power Automate Trigger einrichten:**
   - Erstelle einen **geplanten Cloud-Flow**, der regelmäßig (z.B. stündlich, täglich) prüft.
3. **Gesendete E-Mails abrufen:**
   - Füge eine Aktion hinzu: „Outlook-Mail - Abrufen von E-Mails“.
   - Filterkriterien: Suche nach E-Mails in deinem Gesendet-Ordner mit der Kategorie „Erinnerung erforderlich“ oder einer spezifischen Markierung.
4. **Überprüfung auf Antworten:**
   - Füge eine Aktion hinzu, um im Posteingang nach Antworten auf gesendete E-Mails zu suchen.
   - Dies kann anspruchsvoll sein, da Power Automate keinen nativen Support für das Tracking von Antworten auf individueller Basis bietet. Du könntest Kontrollkriterien wie „Ähnliche Betreffzeile“ oder „Antwort auf“ verwenden.
   - Möglicherweise müsstest du eine eigene Überwachungsliste führen (z.B. Excel-Tabelle oder SharePoint-Liste), die den Status von Antworten trackt.
5. **Erinnerung senden:**
   - Falls innerhalb eines bestimmten Zeitrahmens keine Antwort gefunden wird, sende dir eine automatische Erinnerungs-E-Mail.
   - Nutze die Aktion „E-Mail senden“ in Power Automate, um dich zu benachrichtigen, dass noch keine Antwort eingegangen ist.
### Bemerkungen:
- **Überwachung anpassen:** Möglicherweise ist es notwendig, deine manuell gesendeten E-Mails mit spezifischen Metadaten (zusätzliche Schlüsselwörter, Betreff-Annotationen) zu versehen, um effektive Überwachungen zu ermöglichen.
- **Externe Integration:** Je nach Bedarf könnten auch benutzerdefinierte Lösungen (z.B. kleine Datenbank für ein Systemmanagement oder Drittanbieter-Tools) nützlich sein, um den Status effizienter zu verfolgen.
Diese Lösung würde kontinuierliche Anpassung erfordern, da Power Automate für direktes Antwort-Tracking nicht konzipiert ist.

Du kannst aber bestimmte Workarounds und Strategien verwenden, um zumindest eine gewisse Nachverfolgung zu implementieren.
### Allgemeine Vorgehensweise:
1. **E-Mails über Power Automate senden:**
   - Verwende die Aktion **„Office 365 Outlook - E-Mail senden“**, um gezielt eine E-Mail zu verschicken. Du kannst dynamische Inhalte verwenden, um E-Mails individuell anzupassen.
   - Option: Füge eine eindeutige ID oder ein spezifisches Schlüsselwort in den Betreff oder in den E-Mail-Body ein, um diese Nachrichten leicht erkennen und verfolgen zu können.
2. **Überwachung von Antworten auf gesendete E-Mails:**
   - Trigger: **„Wenn eine neue E-Mail eintrifft“** im Posteingang verwenden.
   - Verwende Bedingungslogiken, um zu prüfen, ob eine neue eingehende E-Mail eine Antwort auf die gesendete E-Mail ist. Dies könnte über den Betreff (z.B. enthält „Re:“ oder das spezifische Schlüsselwort) oder über Konversationsthreads gemacht werden.
   - Da Power Automate E-Mails als separate Elemente sieht, wäre eine direkte Verknüpfung zu vorher gesendeten E-Mails kompliziert ohne zusätzliche Strukturen.
3. **Zusätzliches Tracking mit SharePoint oder Excel:**
   - Um Antworten effektiver zu überwachen, kannst du ein separates Tracking-System nutzen:
     - **Erstellung einer SharePoint-Liste** oder **Excel-Tabelle**, um die IDs oder Betreffzeilen zu speichern.
     - Aktualisierung des Status, wenn eine Antwort erkannt wird.
   - Aktualisiere den Status für jede gesendete E-Mail basierend auf dem Empfang einer entsprechenden Antwort.
4. **Benachrichtigung über nicht-erfolgte Antworten:**
   - Richte Erinnerungen an dich ein, falls innerhalb eines bestimmten Zeitraums keine Antwort vorliegt.
   - Verwende geplante Flows, um deine Tracking-Liste zu überwachen und sende per **„E-Mail senden“** eine Benachrichtigung, dass keine Antwort eingegangen ist.
Du kannst Power Automate nutzen, um E-Mails zu versenden und das Eintreffen von Antworten zu überwachen, allerdings muss die Logik, die Antworten mit gesendeten E-Mails verknüpft, explizit von dir eingerichtet werden. Der Einsatz einer einzigartigen ID oder spezifischer Schlüsselwörter im Betreff der E-Mails kann helfen, die Nachverfolgung zu erleichtern.

### Wichtiges zur Google Kalender-Integration
- Google Kalender selbst unterstützt keine direkte Bild- oder ""Event-Bild""-Funktion.
- Das Elfsight Widget zeigt standardmäßig Event-Details wie Titel, Datum, Ort usw.
- Wenn du möchtest, dass deine Events auf deiner Website Bilder enthalten, gibt es zwei Hauptwege:
## 1. **Bilder in den Event-Beschreibungen in Google Kalender hinzufügen**
### So funktioniert es:
- Beim Erstellen oder Bearbeiten eines Events in Google Kalender kannst du die **Beschreibung** hinzufügen.
- **Füge dort eine Bild-URL** ein, z.B.:
<img src=""https://deinewebsite.de/bilder/deinbild.jpg"" alt=""Eventbild"" width=""200"">
### Was passiert?
- Das ist nur wirksam, wenn das Elfsight Widget **HTML-injection** innerhalb der Event-Details unterstützt.
- Viele Widgets rufen nur die Standard-Infos ab und zeigen keine HTML- oder Bilder aus der Event-Beschreibung an.
- Diese Methode ist **nicht immer zuverlässig**, da viele Kalender-Widgets nur Text und Termine anzeigen, keine HTML-Inhalte oder Bilder.
## 2. **Bilder direkt im Elfsight Widget konfigurieren oder anpassen**
Da Google Kalender nur Ereignistitel und -details übermittelt, kannst du im Elfsight Widget selbst **keine Bilder direkt hinzufügen** für jedes Event, das aus Google Kalender gezogen wird.
### Alternative Lösung:
- **Verwende eine individuelle Lösung**, bei der du für Events eigene Bilder im Widget-Design einstellst oder über eine separate Datenquelle (z.B. CSV, API).
## 3. **Praktische Empfehlung:**
### Einfachste Lösung:
- **Verwende den Elfsight Event Calendar ohne Bilder aus Google Kalender**, sondern erstelle eine **eigene zentrale Event-Liste** (z.B. in einem Google Sheet oder WordPress-Plugin), das Bilder enthält.
- **Importiere oder verbinde diese Daten** mit Elfsight, wenn möglich.
- Google Kalender unterstützt kein direktes Bilder-Embedding bei Events.
- Das Elfsight Widget zeigt in der Regel nur Textinformationen an.
- Um **Event-Bilder** auf deiner Website sichtbar zu machen, kannst du:
  - Bilder in den Event-Beschreibungen in Google Kalender hinzufügen (nicht immer sichtbar im Widget)
  - Oder eine andere Datenquelle für Events mit Bildern nutzen (z.B. CSV-Import, API-Integration)
  - Oder das Design des Widgets anpassen, falls es die Funktion zulässt.

Allerdings hängt die Möglichkeit, HTML-Inhalte wie `<img>`-Tags in den Event-Beschreibungen anzuzeigen, stark von der Art der Integration ab.
**Wichtig:**  
- **Google Kalender** selbst unterstützt das Einfügen von HTML innerhalb der Event-Beschreibung **nicht direkt**. Was du dort eingibst, ist meistens reiner Text.  
- Das Elfsight Widget **kann nur die Textinformationen** (Titel, Datum, Beschreibung usw.) anzeigen, die es vom Kalender erhält.
### Speziell zum Support von HTML in Elfsight:
- **Elfsight Widget unterstützt keine Anzeige von HTML in den Event-Beschreibungen, die direkt aus Google Kalender gezogen werden.**  
- Falls du HTML in den Google Kalender-Beschreibungen einfügst (z.B. `<img src=...>`), wird das Widget **diese HTML-Elemente wahrscheinlich nicht korrekt rendern**, sondern nur als Text anzeigen.
### Fazit:  
- **Direktbilder (HTML-IMG-Tags) in Google Kalender-Beschreibungen werden vom Elfsight Event Calendar Widget in der Regel nicht unterstützt.**  
- Das Widget zeigt nur den Text.  
- Für Bilder in Events ist es notwendig, **entweder nur ein Bild-URL im Beschreibungstext anzugeben (als reiner Link)**, oder alternative Wege zu nutzen.
Wenn du nur ein Bild-URL in der Beschreibung einfügst, z.B.  
`https://deinewebsite.de/bilder/deinbild.jpg`,  
wird dieses als reiner Text angezeigt, **nicht als Bild**.  
Um Bilder im Event-Display sichtbar zu machen, müsstest du auf andere Methoden zurückgreifen, z.B.:
- Verwendung eines **anderen Widgets oder Plugins**, das HTML rendering in Beschreibungen unterstützt,  
- oder eine **individuelle Lösung** mit einer Datenquelle, die Bilder direkt enthält.

1. **Nutzererfahrung und Zugänglichkeit:** Text, der nicht sichtbar ist, kann für Screenreader-Benutzer zugänglich sein, was möglicherweise zu Verwirrung führt.
2. **Darstellung in E-Mail-Clients:** Unterschiedliche E-Mail-Clients und -Plattformen rendern HTML und CSS unterschiedlich. Was in einem Client funktioniert, erscheint in einem anderen möglicherweise ganz anders.
3. **Spam-Erkennung**: Manipulationen wie das Verstecken von Text durch Farbgebung können als täuschende Praxis erkannt und als Spam eingestuft werden.
Statt versuchen, Text zu verstecken, gibt es sicherere und zuverlässigere Methoden, um IDs oder Tracking-Informationen in einer E-Mail unterzubringen, während sie herausstechen:
#### 1. **Verwendung von Metadaten:**
- In vielen Fällen kann die eindeutige ID in einem weniger prominenten Teil der E-Mail untergebracht werden, wie in einer Fußzeile oder in einem unscheinbareren Teil der Nachricht.
#### 2. **Versteckte HTML-Kommentare:**
- Eine andere Möglichkeit ist das Einbetten von Informationen innerhalb eines HTML-Kommentars. Allerdings kann Power Automate solche Kommentare nicht direkt auslesen, da sie nicht für den Endbenutzer, sondern für die Browser gedacht sind.
#### 3. **In einer unauffälligen Weise mitteilen:**
- Fügen Sie die ID als unauffällige Zeichenfolge an das Ende der E-Mail oder in eine Fußzeile ein, in kleinerer Schriftgröße, aber nicht versteckt.
#### 4. **Query-Parameter in Links:**
- Integrieren Sie die ID als Parameter in einem Hyperlink innerhalb der E-Mail – selbst wenn der Link nie geklickt wird, dient er als erkennbarer Platz für die ID.
### Umsetzung eines sicheren Ansatzes:
- **Fußzeilenansatz:**
  - Am Ende der E-Mail-Body:  
    ```html
    <div style=""font-size: 0.8em; color: grey;"">ID: [Ihre_eindeutige_ID]</div>
    ```
  - Dies ist lesbar für Power Automate und für den Benutzer weniger störend.
Wenn die Sicherheit oder Unauffälligkeit von großer Bedeutung ist, denke sorgfältig über die Optionen nach und wähle eine Methode, die sowohl den technischen Anforderungen als auch den Nutzerkomfort bestmöglichst berücksichtigt.

Hier einige Vorschläge und Beispiele:
### 1. Kombination aus Kürzel, Datum und Zweck
**Aufbau:**  
`[Kürzel des Empfängers]_[Datum im Format JJJJMMTT]_[Abkürzung des Zwecks]_[fortlaufende Nummer oder Zufallszahl]`
`AB_20240427_CR_001`  
- `AB` = Kürzel des Empfängers (z.B. Initialen)  
- `20240427` = Datum (JahrMonatTag)  
- `CR` = Abkürzung für ""Customer Review"" oder einen bestimmten Zweck  
- `001` = laufende Nummer oder Zufallszahl
### 2. Verwendung von GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers)
Wenn die Eindeutigkeit des Systems im Vordergrund steht, kannst du in Power Automate eine GUID generieren lassen:
- Power Automate bietet die Funktion `guid()`, die eine zufällige, eindeutige ID erstellt.
`AB_20240427_CR_{guid()}`  
z.B.: `AB_20240427_CR_e1a2b3c4-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab`
### 3. Kombination aus Kürzel, Datum, Zweck und einem Hash
Falls du eine gewisse Anonymität oder Komplexität möchtest, kannst du auch einen Hash aus bestimmten Daten generieren:
- Kombiniere den Empfängerkürzel, Datum, Zweck und generate daraus einen Hash (z.B. MD5 oder SHA-1). In Power Automate kannst du dafür Funktionen oder externe APIs verwenden.
`AB_20240427_CR_{hash}`
### 4. Kürzeln + Datum + laufende Nummer
Wenn du regelmäßig IDs erstellst, kannst du eine laufende Nummer (z.B. 001, 002, 003) verwenden, die bei jedem neuen Element erhöht wird:
- Z.B.: `AB_20240427_OS_005`  
  (für z.B. ""Offene Bestellung"" am 27. April 2024)
### Zusammenfassung:  
**Beispiel-Template für deine IDs:**  
`[Kürzel]_[JJJJMMTT]_[ZweckAbkürzung]_[Nummer oder Zufallszahl]`
**Vorteile:**  
- Leicht verständlich  
- Eindeutig, wenn laufende Nummerierung genutzt wird  
- Schnell generiert in Power Automate  
- Informativ und nachverfolgbar (Datum, Zweck)
Wenn du möchtest, kannst du die ID auch noch mit weiteren Infos anreichern, z.B. Standort, Teamcode etc., je nach Bedarf.

### 3. **JetBrains Rider**
- **All-in-One Solution**: Given your experience with C# and Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider could be an appealing option. It supports .NET development and also provides tools for Java and JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Unified Experience**: Rider provides a consistent experience across different technology stacks, which might help in transitioning between projects.
### 4. **Eclipse with Plugins**
- **Java Development**: Eclipse has been a staple for Java development for years and has a vast ecosystem of plugins.
- **Web Development Plugins**: There are several plugins available for web development, including those that can enhance your workflow with React.
If you're looking for something similar to your current tools, **Visual Studio Code** might be the best choice as it's lightweight and you are already accustomed to its interface and extension model. If you prefer trying a more traditional, feature-rich IDE for Java, **IntelliJ IDEA** is highly recommended by Java developers for its powerful features and robust support.
Ultimately, the choice comes down to personal preference, specific project needs, and how comfortable you are with learning new tools.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":38,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2471,""usageInWh"":1.29667}","aafb471e-7686-40a8-a679-34132957066d","e6c6fdc37f5247779986718dd20d086e","2025-06-25T18:19:11.7242044Z","rdhqALeKrF4FAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF4FAQAAAAAAAA==/","""580192ab-0000-1600-0000-685c3dac0000""","attachments/","1750875564"

Grundlegend geht die Theorie davon aus, dass identische Waren und Dienstleistungen in unterschiedlichen Ländern zu unterschiedlichen Preisen erhältlich sein sollten, wenn man die Wechselkurse berücksichtigt.
Das Grundprinzip der Kaufkraftparität besagt, dass der Wechselkurs zwischen zwei Währungen langfristig so angepasst werden sollte, dass eine bestimmte Menge Geld in beiden Währungen die gleiche Menge an Gütern und Dienstleistungen kaufen kann. Diese theoretische Beziehung wird oft mit dem sogenannten ""Big Mac Index"" veranschaulicht, der die Preise eines Big Macs in verschiedenen Ländern vergleicht, um den ""fairen"" Wechselkurs zu ermitteln.
Es gibt zwei Hauptformen der Kaufkraftparität:
1. **Absolute Kaufkraftparität**: Diese Form besagt, dass der Wechselkurs zwischen zwei Währungen dem Verhältnis der Preisniveaus der beiden Länder entsprechen sollte.
2. **Relative Kaufkraftparität**: Diese Variante berücksichtigt die Inflationsraten in den beiden Ländern. Sie besagt, dass die Veränderung des Wechselkurses im Zeitverlauf dem Unterschied der Inflationsraten der beiden Länder entsprechen sollte.
Die KKP-Theorie wird häufig in der internationalen Wirtschafts- und Finanzanalyse verwendet, hat jedoch ihre Einschränkungen, da sie nicht alle Faktoren, die die Wechselkurse beeinflussen (wie z.B. Kapitalflüsse, politische Stabilität oder Marktpsychologie), berücksichtigt.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":10,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1613,""usageInWh"":0.5149}","970ec20a-6ce1-4d87-a05e-bbfbe5869a48","ea3261f1e4de446fac5055f6c54a4029","2025-06-25T20:13:34.5983047Z","rdhqALeKrF4IAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF4IAQAAAAAAAA==/","""5b012311-0000-1600-0000-685c588b0000""","attachments/","1750882443"

Der Verwendungsansatz analysiert, welche Ausgaben in einer Volkswirtschaft getätigt werden, um das BIP zu bestimmen. Die grundlegende Gleichung für die Berechnung des BIP von der Verwendungsseite lautet:
\[ \text{BIP} = C + I + G + (X - M) \]
Hierbei stehen die einzelnen Komponenten für:
1. **C (Konsumausgaben)**: Dies sind die Ausgaben der privaten Haushalte für Güter und Dienstleistungen. Sie umfassen sowohl langlebige Güter (z.B. Autos) als auch nicht langlebige Güter (z.B. Nahrungsmittel) sowie Dienstleistungen (z.B. Gesundheitswesen, Bildung).
2. **I (Investitionen)**: Diese Kategorie umfasst die Bruttoinvestitionen, die Unternehmen in langlebige Güter (z.B. Maschinen, Gebäude) tätigen, sowie die Investitionen in Bauten und Wohnimmobilien. Es werden auch Lagerinvestitionen berücksichtigt, die die Veränderungen in Beständen von Unternehmen umfassen.
3. **G (Staatliche Ausgaben)**: Diese Komponente bezieht sich auf die Ausgaben der öffentlichen Hand für Güter und Dienstleistungen, einschließlich der Ausgaben für öffentliche Infrastruktur, Bildung und Verteidigung. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass Transferzahlungen (z.B. Renten, Sozialhilfe) nicht in die Berechnung des BIP eingehen, da sie keine Gegenleistung für ausgegebene Leistungen darstellen.
4. **X (Exporte)**: Dies sind die Ausgaben für Güter und Dienstleistungen, die von Inländern an das Ausland verkauft werden.
5. **M (Importe)**: Diese stellen die Ausgaben für Güter und Dienstleistungen dar, die aus dem Ausland bezogen werden. Die Importe werden von den Exporten abgezogen, da sie nicht zur inländischen Produktionsleistung beitragen.
Die Summe dieser vier Komponenten ergibt das BIP, das die gesamte wirtschaftliche Leistung eines Landes in einem bestimmten Zeitraum (typischerweise einem Jahr oder einem Quartal) misst.
Zusammenfassend basiert die Berechnung des BIP von der Verwendungsseite auf der Summe aller Ausgaben in einer Volkswirtschaft und bietet so einen umfassenden Überblick über die wirtschaftlichen Aktivitäten.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":347,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2161,""usageInWh"":0.713}","fc2a5783-ac3a-43ba-afee-de3035dc8de7","ea3261f1e4de446fac5055f6c54a4029","2025-06-25T20:14:15.4668123Z","rdhqALeKrF4JAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF4JAQAAAAAAAA==/","""5b01c714-0000-1600-0000-685c58b30000""","attachments/","1750882483"

Der Verwendungsansatz berücksichtigt die laufenden Ausgaben des Staates (G) für Güter und Dienstleistungen, jedoch nicht die Einnahmen oder Gewinne aus Staatsbetrieben oder -unternehmen.
**Zur Klarstellung:**
1. **Staatliche Ausgaben (G)**: Diese umfassen die Ausgaben der Regierung für Dienstleistungen, Infrastruktur, öffentliche Gehälter usw. Sie reflektieren die Ausgabenpolitik der Regierung und tragen direkt zum BIP bei.
2. **Staatseinnahmen und -gewinne**: Einnahmen, die der Staat aus Steuern, Gebühren oder dem Betrieb von staatlichen Unternehmen erzielt, werden im BIP nicht berücksichtigt. BIP misst nur die Wertschöpfung durch Produktion und Konsum sowie Investitionen. Gewinne oder Überschüsse des Staates werden nicht addiert oder subtrahiert, da sie nicht direkt das Produktionsniveau der Volkswirtschaft widerspiegeln.
3. **Der Einfluss von Staatsgewinnen auf das BIP**: Wenn der Staat zum Beispiel Gewinne aus Staatsunternehmen erzielt und diese Gewinne in Form von Ausgaben (z.B. für soziale Programme) in die Wirtschaft reinvestiert, können diese Ausgaben das BIP erhöhen. Aber die Gewinne selbst werden nicht direkt im BIP erfasst.

**Swiss Stocks (Equities):**  
The Swiss stock market, represented primarily by the Swiss Market Index (SMI), has seen significant growth driven by multinational companies such as Novartis, Roche, Nestlé, and others. Historically, equities in Switzerland have provided an average annual return ranging roughly around 6-8% before inflation, though this can vary depending on the specific time period and market conditions.
**Swiss Real Estate:**  
Swiss real estate has been relatively stable and also appreciated in value over the last two decades, supported by low interest rates and strong demand, particularly in urban centers like Zurich, Geneva, and Basel. However, the overall compounded return for real estate tends to be somewhat lower than equities, typically averaging around 3-5% annually, including rental income appreciation.
**Summary:**  
In general, based on historical data, Swiss stocks have offered higher average returns than real estate over the past two decades in Switzerland. However, real estate often provides more stability and income generation through rentals, and individual investment outcomes can vary depending on location, timing, and specific assets.
**Note:**  
Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Der **Events Calendar von Inlight Labs** kann eine geeignete Lösung sein, um Upcoming Events auf deiner Webseite anzuzeigen und den Google Kalender zu integrieren. Hier einige Hinweise dazu:
### Vorteile des Inlight Labs Events Calendar:
- **Google Kalender Integration:** Ermöglicht es, Google Kalender direkt zu verbinden, sodass deine Events automatisch synchronisiert werden.
- **Benutzerfreundlich:** Einfach in die Webseite zu integrieren und anzupassen.
- **Angepasste Anzeige:** Du kannst das Design und die Darstellung der Events nach deinen Wünschen konfigurieren.
- **Event-Management:** Verwalten und Anzeigen von anstehenden Veranstaltungen in einem übersichtlichen Kalender.
### So kannst du es nutzen:
1. **App oder Plugin installieren:** Je nachdem, ob du eine Plattform wie WordPress benutzt oder eine andere Website hast, lade den Kalender als Plugin oder integriert in die Plattform.
2. **Google Kalender verbinden:** In den Einstellungen des Kalenders kannst du deine Google Kalender-API oder -Konten verbinden. Hierfür benötigst du ggf. API-Schlüssel oder Berechtigungen, die in Google Cloud Console eingerichtet werden müssen.
3. **Events anzeigen:** Nach der Verbindung werden deine Google Kalender-Events automatisch im Inlight Labs Kalender angezeigt.
### Tipps:
- **Dokumentation lesen:** Schau dir die Anleitungen oder Support-Dokumente von Inlight Labs an, um die Integration reibungslos durchzuführen.
- **Fehlerquellen prüfen:** Falls der Kalender wieder nicht lädt, prüfe die API-Berechtigungen, API Limits oder eventuell blockierte Script-Features (z.B. bei restricted Hosting).
Wenn du bereits eine Version von Inlight Labs Events Calendar hast, ist das wahrscheinlich eine gute Wahl, um eine stabile, integrierte Lösung für Upcoming Events zu haben.

Hier sind die allgemeinen Schritte für gängige Szenarien:
**1. Bei Google Kalender:**
- **Bilder in den Beschreibungstext einfügen:**  
  - Öffne den entsprechenden Termin.  
  - Klicke auf ""Bearbeiten"".  
  - Im Beschreibungsfeld kannst du Bilder hinzufügen, indem du sie hochlädst oder per Drag & Drop einfügst. Google Kalender speichert die Bilder im Beschreibungstext.  
  - Alternativ kannst du das Bild auf einer externen URL hosten und den Link einfügen, falls die Plattform das unterstützt.
- **Bilder direkt verlinken:**  
  - Google Kalender unterstützt keine direkte Bild-Upload-Funktion im Termin, aber du kannst einen Link zu einem Bild in einem Cloud-Speicher (z.B. Google Drive, Dropbox) in die Beschreibung einfügen.
**2. Bei anderen Kalender-Tools (z.B. Outlook, Apple Kalender):**
- **Outlook:**  
  - Beim Erstellen oder Bearbeiten eines Termins kannst du im Beschreibungsfeld Bilder hochladen.  
  - Einfach auf ""Einfügen"" > ""Bilder"" klicken und das gewünschte Bild auswählen.
- **Apple Kalender:**  
  - Hier sind Bilder meist nur als Links oder im Notizenfeld möglich.  
  - Alternativ kannst du im Notizenfeld das Bild als Anhang oder Link hinzufügen.
**3. Bilder in den Website- oder Event-Export übernehmen:**
Wenn du die Kalender-Einträge auf deiner Webseite anzeigen möchtest, kannst du die Bilder manuell in die Event-Beschreibung integrieren oder beim Export der Einträge die Bilder mitspeichern und im Layout anzeigen lassen.
**Kurz zusammengefasst:**  
- **In den Kalender-Eintrag im Beschreibungstext Bilder hochladen oder verlinken.**  
- **Falls dein System das unterstützt, kannst du direkt Bilder hinzufügen.**  
- **Beim Export oder der Integration in die Webseite kannst du dann die Bilder entsprechend anzeigen lassen.**

Given your 3x3 grid setup using the CSS Grid Layout, you can achieve this by using `grid-column` and `grid-row` properties to place the item in the desired cell. Here's how you can do it:
1. Ensure your container has a CSS rule like you've defined:
.container {
    display: grid;
    gap: 4px;
2. Align the single grid item in the center by placing it in the second column and second row. Assuming your HTML structure is like this:
    <div class=""item"">Centered Item</div>
You would apply the following CSS to the `.item`:
.item {
    grid-column: 2 / 3; /* Starts at column 2, ends before column 3 */
    grid-row: 2 / 3; /* Starts at row 2, ends before row 3 */
This approach will ensure the single item spans only the middle cell of the grid, effectively centering it in the grid layout.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":52,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1074,""usageInWh"":0.58658}","39d82485-c0d1-42f1-866e-0334d82056c7","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-26T09:02:48.2846556Z","rdhqALeKrF4VAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF4VAQAAAAAAAA==/","""6a013087-0000-1600-0000-685d0cc70000""","attachments/","1750928583"

**1. Verwendung eines separaten Dokumentes oder Notizblocks**  
Erstelle ein separates Dokument (z.B. in Google Docs, Word, Notion oder OneNote), in dem du alle Bilder und relevante Infos zu den Terminen sammelst. Den Link dazu kannst du dann in den Kalender-Eintrag einfügen.
**2. Bilder in einer Cloud speichern und Link teilen**  
Lade alle Bilder in einen Cloud-Dienst hoch (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive) und kopiere die Freigabelinks. Füge diese Links im Kalender-Eintrag (z.B. in der Beschreibung) ein, so können alle Beteiligten die Bilder öffnen.
**3. Nutzen von dedicated Event-Apps oder Projektmanagement-Tools**  
Tools wie Trello, Asana, Notion oder Monday.com bieten mehr Flexibilität bei Anhängen und Bildern. Damit kannst du Termine als Aufgaben anlegen und alle Bilder, Dateien und Notizen direkt dazu verwalten.
**4. Bilder per E-Mail oder Messaging-Apps teilen**  
Wenn es nur um die Organisation im kleinen Kreis geht, kannst du den Termin im Kalender mit einem Hinweis versehen und dann die Bilder per E-Mail, WhatsApp oder einem anderen Messenger an die relevanten Personen schicken.
**5. Bild-URL in Beschreibung einfügen (falls unterstützt)**  
Falls dein Kalender das erlaubt, kannst du eine URL zu einem Bild hosten und diese URL in die Terminbeschreibung einfügen. Damit ist das Bild auch bei anderen zugänglich.
Wenn dein aktuelles Kalender-Tool keine Bilder direkt unterstützt, ist das Hochladen in eine Cloud und das Teilen der Links die flexibelste Lösung. Alternativ kannst du spezielle Projektmanagement- oder Notiz-Apps verwenden, die eine bessere Medienintegration bieten.

Hier einige mögliche Ursachen und Lösungsansätze, um das Problem dauerhaft zu beheben:
Mögliche Ursachen:
1. **Cookies und Cache**: Wenn dein Browser Cookies oder Cache regelmäßig löscht, können Verbindungen wie zu Google Kalender verloren gehen.
2. **Sitzungs- oder Authentifizierungsprobleme**: Die Verbindung zu Google wird eventuell nicht dauerhaft gespeichert, weil die Authentifizierung bei jedem erneuten Laden neu erfolgen muss.
3. **Falsche Einstellung oder fehlende Speicherung**: Vielleicht wurden die Verbindungseinstellungen nicht dauerhaft gespeichert oder es gibt einen Bug im Plugin.
4. **Kompatibilitätsprobleme**: Browser-Plugins, Sicherheitssoftware oder Browser-Updates könnten das Speichern der Verbindung verhindern.
5. **Fehler im Plugin oder Hosting**: Auch Software-Bugs oder Server-Probleme können dazu führen.
Lösungsansätze:
1. **Browser-Einstellungen prüfen**:
   - Stelle sicher, dass Cookies und Cache nicht automatisch gelöscht werden.
   - Nutze einen Browser im privaten/incognito Modus, um zu testen, ob das Problem dort auch besteht. Falls nicht, liegt es an den Browser-Einstellungen.
2. **Plugin/Einstellungen**:
   - Überprüfe, ob du in den Plugin-Einstellungen eine Option hast, die Verbindung dauerhaft zu speichern.
   - Stelle sicher, dass du nach der Verbindung auf „Speichern“ oder „Bestätigen“ klickst.
3. **Google-Konto erneut verbinden**:
   - Entferne die Google-Verbindung und stelle sie erneut her, um sicherzugehen, dass alles richtig gespeichert wird.
4. **Plugin-Bug melden**:
   - Kontaktiere den Support von lfsight oder schaue in deren Support-Forum nach, ob das ein bekanntes Problem ist.
5. **Aktuelle Version nutzen**:
   - Stelle sicher, dass du die neueste Version des Plugins installiert hast.
6. **Hosting-Umgebung prüfen**:
   - Wenn du auf einem Shared-Hosting bist, könnten Sicherheits- oder Caching-Mechanismen Probleme machen.
7. **Browser wechseln** oder einen anderen Computer ausprobieren.
Wenn all diese Schritte nicht helfen, könnte eine dauerhaftere Lösung darin bestehen, eine andere Kalender-Integrationsmethode zu verwenden oder ein anderes Plugin, das diese Verbindung stabil hält.
Das Problem liegt wahrscheinlich an einer fehlenden dauerhaften Speicherung der Verbindung oder an Browser-Einstellungen. Überprüfe die Einstellungen, stelle sicher, dass du alles richtig speicherst, und kontaktiere ggf. den Plugin-Support, falls das Problem weiterhin besteht.
**Wenn du möchtest**, kannst du mir auch genaue Angaben zu deinem Setup schicken (z.B. Browser, Hosting-Umgebung, die genaue Version des Plugins), dann kann ich dir gezielter weiterhelfen.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":508,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2816,""usageInWh"":0.65192}","375c0d23-19ba-4392-9396-9ca519b7c194","de3e3163a6e04819a87f34df897f78aa","2025-06-26T09:05:46.0914789Z","rdhqALeKrF4YAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF4YAQAAAAAAAA==/","""6a017ea4-0000-1600-0000-685d0da90000""","attachments/","1750928809"

Betreff: Problem mit dauerhafter Google Kalender Verbindung und Design beim lfsight Event Calendar
Sehr geehrtes Support-Team,
ich habe ein Problem mit dem lfsight Event Calendar auf meiner Webseite. Jedes Mal, wenn ich die Seite neu lade, ist der Kalender nicht mehr mit meinem Google Kalender verbunden. Zudem verschwindet das ursprüngliche Design, sodass ich die Verbindung sowie das Design erneut in den Einstellungen herstelllen muss.
Dieses Verhalten ist für meinen Workflow äußerst problematisch, da ich das meinem Kunden nicht zumuten kann. Das System sollte die Einstellungen und Verbindungen dauerhaft speichern und behalten, auch nach einem Seiten-Reload.
Können Sie mir bitte eine Lösung oder einen Workaround für dieses Problem anbieten? Ich freue mich auf Ihre Rückmeldung.
Vielen Dank im Voraus.

Subject: Issue with Persistent Google Calendar Connection and Default Template Loading in lfsight Event Calendar
Dear Support Team,
I am experiencing an issue with the lfsight Event Calendar on my website. Every time I reload the page, the calendar is no longer connected to my Google Calendar. Instead, it loads the default template with the standard events. Additionally, the original design disappears, requiring me to reconnect the calendar and reconfigure the design settings each time.
This behavior is highly problematic for my workflow, as I can't reasonably expect my clients to handle these repeated configurations. The system should store and retain the settings and connections permanently, even after a page reload.
Could you please provide a solution or workaround for this issue? I look forward to your response.
Thank you in advance.

Instead, you would handle all such logic in the component class and use the results or simplify the logic for the template.
Assuming you want to conditionally display a part of the template based on the result of the `isCurrentStateValid` logic, you would use it as follows in the template:
First, ensure your component class exposes a method or a simple boolean property that evaluates the result:
In your component file:
// Assuming PageStates and currentState are defined appropriately
  currentState: PageStates;
In your component template file (`.html`):
  <!-- Your conditional content here, will only be shown if isCurrentStateValid is true -->
  The current state is valid!
<div *ngIf=""!isCurrentStateValid"">
  <!-- Content to show if the state is not valid -->
  The current state is not valid!
What this does:
- The component exposes `isCurrentStateValid` as a getter, which evaluates the condition.
- The template uses `*ngIf` to conditionally render content based on the value of `isCurrentStateValid`.
This approach cleanly separates logic and presentation by handling all necessary evaluations within the component class while using the outcomes to control the template's rendering logic.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":139,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2039,""usageInWh"":1.09352}","b2dd5270-390a-45e1-a0e3-ea0a33bb0cfc","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-26T09:17:16.4543517Z","rdhqALeKrF4gAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF4gAQAAAAAAAA==/","""6a01cdf4-0000-1600-0000-685d10300000""","attachments/","1750929456"

Instead, you need to evaluate such logic within your component's TypeScript code. However, if you want to simplify it to check if any of the states are loaded, you should prepare a method or a property in your component class that evaluates this condition, and then use that in the template.
Here, I'll guide you to do exactly that by introducing a method to determine if any of the specific states are loaded:
### TypeScript Component
First, simplify and ensure you have a function in your component to check the required condition:
  currentState: PageStates; // Assuming PageStates and currentState are correctly defined as per your context
  get hasAnyValidState(): boolean {
    // Check if at least one of the required states is loaded
    return (this.currentState & requiredStates) !== 0;
### Angular Template
Then use this in your Angular template with `*ngIf`:
<div *ngIf=""hasAnyValidState"">
  <!-- Content shown when at least one valid state is loaded -->
  At least one required state is loaded!
<div *ngIf=""!hasAnyValidState"">
  <!-- Content shown when none of the required states are loaded -->
  No required states are currently loaded!
- **`hasAnyValidState` Getter**: This checks if any bit in `currentState` matches any bit in `requiredStates`, meaning at least one of the desired states is loaded.
- **`*ngIf=""hasAnyValidState""`**: Conditionally renders HTML content depending on whether any required states are loaded.
This structure ensures that the bitwise logic remains in the TypeScript code, which is where such logic should reside, allowing the HTML to focus on presentation.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":583,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2204,""usageInWh"":1.25315}","fd4fe9bd-c226-4ba8-9752-673605ef61e3","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-26T09:17:48.7439802Z","rdhqALeKrF4hAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF4hAQAAAAAAAA==/","""6a01e9f9-0000-1600-0000-685d10590000""","attachments/","1750929497"

Für die Nutzung als Corporate Identity (CI) oder als Vereinslogo gelten spezielle Anforderungen:
1. **Lizenztyp prüfen:**  
   Adobe Stock bietet in der Regel Standard- und erweitere Lizenzen an. Die Standard-Lizenz ist meist ausreichend für temporäre oder weniger dominante Nutzung, während die erweiterte Lizenz oft für Logos und CI-Zwecke empfohlen wird.
2. **Vektordateien bevorzugen:**  
   Für Logos und CI sollte man möglichst Vektor-Dateien (z.B. AI, EPS) verwenden, um eine verlustfreie Skalierung zu gewährleisten.
3. **Verwendung als Vereins- oder Firmenlogo:**  
   Für die Verwendung als Logo eines Vereins oder im Rahmen der Corporate Identity ist es wichtig, dass das gekaufte Logo einzigartig ist. Viele Logos auf Stock-Plattformen sind jedoch generisch oder können mehrfach lizenziert werden, was bei einem Vereinslogo problematisch sein kann.
4. **Rechte & Markenrechte:**  
   Wenn das gekaufte Logo Markenzeichen oder urheberrechtlich geschützte Elemente enthält, könnten Sie Probleme bekommen, es als offizielles CI-Logo zu nutzen. Es ist ratsam, darauf zu achten, dass keine Markenrechte verletzt werden.
5. **Individueller Entwurf vs. stock-Logo:**  
   Für die offizielle Verwendung eines Logos im Vereins- oder Firmenkontext ist es meistens sicherer, ein einzigartiges, selbst erstelltes Logo verwenden oder von einem Designer speziell anfertigen zu lassen.
Wenn Sie ein Logo auf Adobe Stock kaufen, sollten Sie die Lizenzbedingungen genau prüfen. Für die Verwendung als CI oder Vereinslogo empfiehlt sich in den meisten Fällen eine erweiterte Lizenz oder die Beauftragung eines Designers, um rechtliche Probleme zu vermeiden.
Bei Unsicherheiten ist es empfehlenswert, einen Rechtsexperten oder einen Fachanwalt für Urheberrecht zu konsultieren.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":86,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1919,""usageInWh"":0.43401}","90ed5830-d9cb-4e9c-aec1-c18be8a93444","de3e3163a6e04819a87f34df897f78aa","2025-06-26T11:51:05.7973525Z","rdhqALeKrF4iAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF4iAQAAAAAAAA==/","""6f01fd55-0000-1600-0000-685d344a0000""","attachments/","1750938698"

Simply put, it allows you to access various Microsoft Cloud services resources. Here's why and when you might do so:
### Reasons to Import Microsoft.Graph
1. **Access to Microsoft 365 Data and Services:**
   - Microsoft Graph provides access to a wide range of Microsoft 365 services such as Outlook, OneDrive, Teams, OneNote, Planner, SharePoint, and more through a single endpoint: `https://graph.microsoft.com`.
2. **Unified API Surface:**
   - It offers a unified API to interact with diverse services, meaning you can manage your enterprise's user base and other resources in a consistent way across different services.
3. **Resource Management:**
   - You can use it to manage users, groups, and permissions, control resources like mail, calendar, and drives across your organization.
4. **Automation and Customization:**
   - Automate tasks such as synchronizing directories, managing identities, or building custom workflows that integrate with Microsoft 365 resources.
5. **Integration with Custom Applications:**
   - If you are developing a custom business application that requires interaction with Microsoft services, integrating Microsoft Graph will allow your application to process fit to the dynamic needs of users and organizations.
6. **Secure and Scalable:**
   - Utilize a secure, high-scale platform with OAuth2 protocol-based identity handling and authorization. 
### Basic Example of Using Microsoft.Graph
To use Microsoft Graph in a `.NET` class:
1. **Install the Microsoft.Graph NuGet Package:**
   - You can add the package through the NuGet Package Manager or by using the following command in the Package Manager Console:
     ```shell
     Install-Package Microsoft.Graph
2. **Using Microsoft.Graph in Your Code:**
   - Begin by authenticating a client, then make calls to the API:
   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.Graph;
   using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
   using System.Net.Http.Headers;
   public class GraphService
   {
       private static GraphServiceClient GetGraphServiceClient()
       {
           // Authentication with MSAL for confidential client apps
           var confidentialClient = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder
               .Create(""your-client-id"")
               .WithClientSecret(""your-client-secret"")
               .WithAuthority(new Uri(""https://login.microsoftonline.com/your-tenant-id""))
               .Build();
           var authProvider = new DelegateAuthenticationProvider(async requestMessage =>
           {
               var token = await confidentialClient
                   .AcquireTokenForClient(new[] { ""https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"" })
                   .ExecuteAsync();
               requestMessage.Headers.Authorization =
                   new AuthenticationHeaderValue(""Bearer"", token.AccessToken);
           });
           return new GraphServiceClient(authProvider);
       }
       public async Task GetUserAsync(string userId)
           var graphClient = GetGraphServiceClient();
           var user = await graphClient.Users[userId]
               .Request()
               .GetAsync();
           Console.WriteLine($""User: {user.DisplayName}"");
Importing `Microsoft.Graph` in a .NET class allows you to interact programmatically with Microsoft cloud services uniformly and efficiently. This integration can facilitate various business needs and contribute to the system's integration with Microsoft services.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":1078,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3636,""usageInWh"":2.06762}","1faefaa7-cad3-442d-9831-2449d79c53d2","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-26T13:04:03.2965768Z","rdhqALeKrF4pAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF4pAQAAAAAAAA==/","""71014f69-0000-1600-0000-685d455a0000""","attachments/","1750943066"

- Both snippets are working with objects like `billingRun`, `dtoBillingRun`, and `dto`, which seem to be domain or data transfer objects.
- The method `.ToDataTransferList()` suggests some conversion from domain models to DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).
- The properties `SharedUsers`, `SharedTeams`, and their assignment or transformation are specific to your application's data layer or business logic.
**In particular:**
if (billingRun.SharedUsers != null)
    dtoBillingRun.SharedUsers = billingRun.SharedUsers.ToDataTransferList();
if (billingRun.SharedTeams != null)
    dtoBillingRun.SharedTeams = billingRun.SharedTeams.ToDataTransferList();

dto.SharedTeamsSuper.AssignSmart(() => dtoBillingRun.SharedTeams = billingRun.SharedTeams.ToDataTransferList(dto.SharedTeams));
### Does this code involve `Microsoft.Graph`?
**Based on what you've posted:**  
**No,** these snippets do not show any use of `Microsoft.Graph`. They don't:
- Instantiate or reference `Microsoft.Graph` classes, such as `GraphServiceClient`, `User`, `Group`, etc.
- Call methods or properties that are specific to the Microsoft Graph SDK.
### When *would* Microsoft.Graph be used?
- If you had code that *retrieved* user or team information from Microsoft 365 (e.g., calling `GraphServiceClient.Users.GetAsync()`),
- or if you needed to *convert* or *populate* `SharedUsers` or `SharedTeams` with data fetched from Microsoft Graph,
then that code would involve `Microsoft.Graph`.
### **Summary:**
**In the snippets shown, `Microsoft.Graph` is not used.**  
They seem to handle data transformation and assignment within your application's data layer. If elsewhere in your project you're pulling data from Microsoft 365 services, then `Microsoft.Graph` would be involved there.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":827,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2040,""usageInWh"":0.51129}","3b0ad3b8-e05a-446e-a617-27ca599191df","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-26T13:06:08.0434329Z","rdhqALeKrF4qAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF4qAQAAAAAAAA==/","""71011e78-0000-1600-0000-685d45d10000""","attachments/","1750943185"

Allerdings basiere ich auf meinem trainierten Wissen bis Oktober 2023 und kann dir daher eine Zusammenfassung der häufig genannten Meinungen und Argumente zu den Chancen (Segnungen) und Gefahren von Künstlicher Intelligenz aus christlicher, ethischer und gesellschaftlicher Sicht geben:
**Mögliche Segen von KI:**
1. **Verbesserung der Gesundheitsversorgung:** KI kann bei Diagnosen, personalisierten Behandlungen und der Forschung nach Heilmitteln helfen, Leben retten und Leiden lindern.
2. **Bildung und Chancengleichheit:** KI-gestützte Lernsysteme können individuenorientiert lehren und Barrieren abbauen, was mehr Menschen zum Zugang zu Bildung ermöglicht.
3. **Wirtschaftliche Innovation:** Neue Technologien schaffen Jobs, fördern Innovation und unterstützen nachhaltige Entwicklung.
4. **Hilfe für Bedürftige:** KI kann in Katastrophenmanagement, Armutsbekämpfung und globaler Unterstützung eingesetzt werden.
5. **Förderung menschlicher Kreativität:** Automatisierung repetitiver Aufgaben verschafft Menschen mehr Raum für kreative, soziale und spirituelle Tätigkeiten.
**Mögliche Gefahren von KI:**
1. **Ethische und moralische Fragen:** Automatisierte Entscheidungen können unethisch sein, z.B. bei autonomen Waffensystemen oder unfairen Algorithmen.
2. **Verlust der Menschlichkeit:** Übermäßiger Einsatz von KI könnte menschliche Fähigkeiten und zwischenmenschliche Beziehungen beeinträchtigen.
3. **Arbeitsplatzverlust:** Automatisierung kann zu Massenarbeitslosigkeit in bestimmten Branchen führen, was soziale Ungleichheiten verschärft.
4. **Überwachung und Privatsphäre:** KI-gestützte Überwachungssysteme könnten Grundrechte verletzen.
5. **Autonomie und Kontrolle:** Die Gefahr, dass KI-Systeme außer Kontrolle geraten oder autonom über Entscheidungen entscheiden, die Menschen betreffen.
**Aus christlicher Perspektive:**
- **Segen:** KI kann helfen, das Leben zu verbessern, Nächstenliebe praktizieren und Gottes Schöpfung verantwortungsvoll nutzen.
- **Gefahr:** Missbrauch, Gier, Machtmissbrauch und die Vernachlässigung moralischer Werte könnten durch KI verstärkt werden.

Hier eine Zusammenfassung, was das bedeuten könnte:
**Mögliche positive Bedeutungen (Segnungen):**
1. **Förderung der Nächstenliebe:** KI kann genutzt werden, um Bedürftigen schneller zu helfen, z. B. durch humanitäre Einsätze, medizinische Versorgung oder Unterstützung bei Katastrophen. Dies entspricht christlichen Prinzipien der Liebe und Fürsorge.
2. **Bildung und Zugang zu Wissen:** KI-gestützte Bildung erleichtert den Zugang zu Bildung für benachteiligte Gruppen, was für die Evangelisierung und das Christentum insgesamt eine Chance bietet.
3. **Bewahrung der Schöpfung:** Wenn KI dazu beiträgt, Umweltprobleme besser zu verstehen und nachhaltige Lösungen zu entwickeln, kann das im Einklang mit dem biblischen Auftrag stehen, die Erde zu bewahren.
4. **Förderung von Gerechtigkeit:** Durch den Einsatz von KI können soziale Ungerechtigkeiten erkannt und abgebaut werden, was die christliche Botschaft von Gnade und Gleichheit widerspiegelt.
**Mögliche Risiken und Herausforderungen (Gefahren):**
1. **Verlust menschlicher Würde:** Übermäßige Automatisierung und Kontrolle durch KI könnten den Schwerpunkt auf den Menschen als Geschöpf Gottes verwässern und die individuelle Würde bedrohen.
2. **Ethische Dilemmas:** Entscheidungen durch KI, z. B. bei autonomen Waffensystemen oder bei medizinischen Eingriffen, stellen Fragen nach moralischer Verantwortung, die im Einklang mit christlichen Werten geklärt werden müssen.
3. **Verlust zwischenmenschlicher Beziehungen:** Die Digitalisierung und Automatisierung könnten die Gemeinschaft und die persönliche Beziehung, die im Christentum zentral sind, verringern.
4. **Missbrauch und Gier:** KI-Technologien könnten für egoistische oder destruktive Zwecke missbraucht werden, was im Widerspruch zu christlicher Ethik steht.
5. **Spirituelle Bedenken:** Es besteht die Gefahr, dass technologische Entwicklungen das Vertrauen in Gott und die spirituelle Orientierung untergraben, wenn sie als Ersatz für Gottes Schöpfungsordnung gesehen werden.
**Was könnte das im christlichen Umfeld bedeuten?**
- **Verantwortungsvoller Umgang:** Christen sind aufgerufen, KI-Technologien verantwortungsvoll zu nutzen, um Liebe, Gerechtigkeit und Barmherzigkeit sichtbar werden zu lassen.
- **Ethik in der Entwicklung:** Es ist wichtig, ethische Kriterien aus christlicher Perspektive in die Gestaltung und den Einsatz von KI zu integrieren.
- **Glaube und Innovation:** Innovationen sollten stets im Einklang mit dem Glauben stehen, um Menschen zu fördern und die Schöpfung zu bewahren.
- **Bewusstseinsbildung:** Christen sollten sich über Chancen und Risiken informieren und aktiv an Debatten teilnehmen, um die technologische Entwicklung im Sinne christlicher Werte mitzugestalten.
Kurz gesagt, im christlichen Umfeld bedeutet die Auseinandersetzung mit KI eine Balance zwischen Nutzen und Vorsorge, zwischen technologischem Fortschritt und moralischer Verantwortung – immer mit der Orientierung an der Liebe Gottes und der Würde des menschlichen Lebens.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":547,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3220,""usageInWh"":0.73949}","77c8a155-7564-46ad-84d3-c2f595557438","de3e3163a6e04819a87f34df897f78aa","2025-06-26T14:10:47.2386944Z","rdhqALeKrF4wAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF4wAQAAAAAAAA==/","""7301fc42-0000-1600-0000-685d54f90000""","attachments/","1750947065"

**Vortragsthema: Im Wandel unserer Welt – Chancen, Herausforderungen und Verantwortung im Zeitalter der Künstlichen Intelligenz**
Liebe Zuhörerinnen und Zuhörer,
wir leben heute in einer Zeit des tiefgreifenden Wandels. Technologische Innovationen, insbesondere im Bereich der Künstlichen Intelligenz, verändern fast alle Bereiche unseres Lebens – von der Arbeit über die Kommunikation bis hin zu unserer Art, Gemeinschaft zu erleben. Wir befinden uns in einem globalen Umbruch, der mit ungeahnten Möglichkeiten, aber auch mit erheblichen Herausforderungen verbunden ist.
Warum betrifft uns das alle? Weil wir nicht nur passiv Zeugen dieses Wandels sind, sondern aktiv mitgestalten können. Unsere Entscheidungen heute prägen die Zukunft unserer Gesellschaft, unserer Umwelt und auch das Leben kommender Generationen. Es ist daher essenziell, dass wir uns mit diesen Entwicklungen auseinandersetzen, um verantwortungsvoll damit umzugehen.
In diesem Vortrag möchten wir uns damit beschäftigen, was Künstliche Intelligenz für unser christliches Verständnis bedeuten kann – sowohl als Chance, um Gutes zu bewirken, als auch als Herausforderung, der wir uns stellen müssen. Wir werden darüber sprechen, wie wir ethisch handeln können, warum es wichtig ist, den menschlichen Wert zu bewahren, und welchen Einfluss diese Technologien auf unsere Gemeinschaft und unsere Werte haben.
Seid gespannt, auf eine Reise durch die Chancen, Risiken und unsere Verantwortung im Zeitalter der KI.

Hier eine überarbeitete Version, die den Fokus auf Grenzen, die Frage, wie viel wir mittragen können, und den evangelischen Aspekt legt:
Wir befinden uns in einer Phase tiefgreifender Veränderungen. Diese Entwicklungen bringen enorme Chancen mit sich – aber auch Risiken, die unsere Grenzen testen. Wie weit dürfen wir mitgehen? Wo liegt die Grenze zwischen Fortschritt und Verantwortungsbewusstsein? Es geht nicht nur um technische oder gesellschaftliche Fragen, sondern auch um die Werte, die unsere Entscheidungen leiten.  
Denn letztlich kommt es darauf an, was wirklich zählt: Vertrauen, Verantwortung und eine Orientierung, die den Menschen ins Zentrum stellt. In einer Welt im Wandel bleibt eine zentrale Frage: Woran glauben wir wirklich? Worauf bauen wir auf, wenn alles in Bewegung ist?  
Der Blick ist nicht nur auf das, was möglich ist, sondern auch auf das, was wir noch verteidigen und bewahren müssen – mit Blick auf die christlichen Grundwerte und die Verantwortung, die daraus erwächst.

Es soll eine Spannung aufgebaut werden, die im weiteren Verlauf des Vortrags beantwortet wird.  
Hier ein Vorschlag, der diesen Ansatz widerspiegelt:  
In einer Welt im Wandel stellen sich zentrale Fragen: Wie viel dürfen wir mitgehen? Wo sind die Grenzen? Und was ist gerade deshalb so wichtig – im Kleinen wie im Großen?  
Was bedeutet es, Verantwortung zu tragen, wenn Entwicklungen rasen? Woran orientieren wir uns, wenn alles im Fluss zu sein scheint?  
Und vielleicht die wichtigste Frage: Woran wollen wir uns letztlich orientieren?  
Der Vortrag lädt ein, genau diese Fragen zu reflektieren. Nicht um sofort Antworten zu liefern, sondern um gemeinsam herauszufinden, worauf es wirklich ankommt.

Mögliche Risiken und Herausforderungen im Umgang mit Künstlicher Intelligenz umfassen verschiedene Gefahren. Eine zentrale Sorge ist der Verlust menschlicher Würde: Übermäßige Automatisierung und Kontrolle durch KI könnten den Menschen in seiner einzigartigen Würde schmälern und die Bedeutung des Geschöpfseins Gottes untergraben. Ethische Dilemmas treten auf, zum Beispiel bei autonomen Waffensystemen oder medizinischen Entscheidungen, bei denen Verantwortlichkeiten geklärt werden müssen, um im Einklang mit christlichen Werten zu handeln. Zudem besteht die Gefahr, dass zwischenmenschliche Beziehungen durch Digitalisierung und Automatisierung zunehmend verloren gehen, was im Widerspruch zur christlichen Betonung von Gemeinschaft und Nächstenliebe steht. Missbrauchspotenziale, etwa für eigennützige oder zerstörerische Zwecke, sind eine weitere Herausforderung, da sie die Werte der Ethik und Moral bedrohen. Schließlich gibt es auch spirituelle Bedenken: Die Angst, dass technologische Entwicklungen das Vertrauen in Gott schwächen und spirituelle Orientierung verdrängen könnten, wenn sie als Ersatz für Gottes Schöpfungsordnung betrachtet werden.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":463,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1257,""usageInWh"":0.32138}","2465e02f-9b7b-444f-ad63-b8689270a40c","de3e3163a6e04819a87f34df897f78aa","2025-06-26T14:21:15.0297392Z","rdhqALeKrF45AQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF45AQAAAAAAAA==/","""730116a4-0000-1600-0000-685d57700000""","attachments/","1750947696"

Hier sind einige Empfehlungen:
1. **Reface**  
   Diese App ist bekannt für das Erstellen von Deepfake-Videos, in denen Gesichter animiert werden. Sie eignet sich zwar vor allem für Gesichtsaustausch, bietet aber auch Funktionen für Altersveränderungen.
2. **FaceApp**  
   FaceApp ist eine beliebte App, die speziell für das Ändern des Alters, Geschlechts oder anderer Gesichtszüge entwickelt wurde. Sie kann Fotos in eine Sequenz verwandeln, die den Eindruck erweckt, die Person altert oder jüngt.
3. **Deep Nostalgia** (von MyHeritage)  
   Diese Plattform erstellt animierte Porträt-Videos, die Gesichtsausdrücke und Bewegungen simulieren. Sie ist vor allem für alte Fotos gedacht, um lebensechte Bewegungen zu erzeugen. Für Altersveränderungen ist sie eher weniger geeignet, aber sie bietet interessante Animationsmöglichkeiten.
4. **Didimo** oder **Avatarify**  
   Einige Tools und Apps, die 3D-Avatare erzeugen und animieren, ermöglichen auch die Alterungseffekte, allerdings sind diese eher auf Avatar-Animationen ausgelegt.
5. **D-ID**  
   Diese Plattform bietet KI-basierte Animationsdienste an, bei denen auf Basis eines Fotos eine animierte Videosequenz erstellt werden kann. Einige Funktionen ermöglichen es, das „Alter“ der Person visuell zu verändern.
**Hinweis:** Für realistische Altersübergänge (von Jung zu Alt) ist oft eine Kombination aus Fotobearbeitung und animierten Effekten notwendig. Manche Tools sind kostenpflichtig oder erfordern eine Anmeldung.
Wenn du eine einfache Lösung suchst, probiere **FaceApp** oder **D-ID**. Für professionellere oder detaillierte Animationen kannst du auch auf spezialisierte Software oder Online-Dienste zurückgreifen, die KI-Technologie für Altersanimationen verwenden.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":34,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1910,""usageInWh"":0.42848}","65e943f2-3024-4575-8038-f14631f640c7","de3e3163a6e04819a87f34df897f78aa","2025-06-26T14:39:46.7588832Z","rdhqALeKrF47AQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF47AQAAAAAAAA==/","""74010f4f-0000-1600-0000-685d5bdd0000""","attachments/","1750948829"

Hier sind einige wichtige Punkte dazu:
### 1. Power Automate Desktop ist so konzipiert, dass du es auf deinem PC installieren und ausführen kannst, während du normal weiterarbeitest.
- Das Automatisieren von Aufgaben geschieht im Hintergrund oder im Zuge spezieller automatisierter Abläufe.
- Während die Roboter (Bots) Aufgaben ausführen, kannst du weiterhin am PC arbeiten.
### 2. Attended vs. Unattended RPA
- **Attended RPA (begleitende Automatisierung):**  
  Diese läuft in deiner Anwesenheit, z.B. ein Bot, der bei bestimmten Aktionen assistiert, während du arbeitest. Du startest und stoppst die Automatisierungen nach Bedarf.
- **Unattended RPA (unbeaufsichtigte Automatisierung):**  
  Das sind vollautomatisierte Prozesse, die im Hintergrund laufen, häufig auch außerhalb deiner normalen Arbeitszeiten, ohne direkte Interaktion deinerseits.
### 3. Ressourcen und Leistung
- Solange die Automatisierungsaufgaben keine übermäßige Systemauslastung verursachen, kannst du problemlos weiterarbeiten.
- Es ist ratsam, Automatisierungs-Workflows so zu planen, dass sie keine Konflikte mit deiner Arbeit verursachen, z.B. indem sie nur in bestimmten Zeiten ausgeführt werden.

","0","gpt-4.1-nano","2","true","2025-06-26T19:26:42.5481574Z","To estimate the energy consumption of a company of 20 people using AI throughout the day, we need to consider several factors:
1. **Type of AI Tasks:** Whether the AI work involves simple text processing, training large language models, image processing, etc.
2. **Infrastructure:** Are the users running AI locally on their computers, or are they accessing centralized cloud-based AI services?
3. **Device Energy Consumption:** The power used by individual devices (laptops, desktops) when running AI tasks.
4. **Server / Data Center Usage:** If AI processing is done on external servers, the data center's energy consumption per task.
### Simplified Estimation Approach
Assuming:
- Each person is using a laptop or desktop.
- AI usage involves mainly running inference (not training complex models).
- Devices are actively used during the entire workday (~8 hours).
### Typical Device Power Usage
- **Laptop:** ~15-60W (average around 30W)
- **Desktop:** ~100-250W
Let's assume an average of **50W per device** for simplicity.
### Calculating Energy Consumption
- **Per person:** 50W * 8 hours = 400 Wh = 0.4 kWh
- **For 20 people:** 0.4 kWh * 20 = **8 kWh**
*Note:* This is the baseline energy for running devices during the day, regardless of AI usage.
### Additional AI Processing Energy (Cloud-based)
If AI processing is done via cloud services, the energy per inference varies widely, but on average:
- A single inference might consume **around 1-10 Joules** of energy on data center hardware.
- For complex tasks, the energy can be higher, but many cloud providers optimize for low energy per inference.
**Example calculation:**
- Suppose each person makes 100 AI inferences during the day.
- For 20 people: 2,000 inferences.
- At 5 Joules per inference:
**Total energy:** 2,000 inferences * 5 J = 10,000 Joules = 10 kJ = 0.0028 kWh
This is negligible compared to device energy consumption.
### **Summary**

### Step 1: Determine the energy generated by 5 people riding bicycles for 1 hour each day
- **Average human-powered bicycle generator efficiency:** Typically, a person can produce about **100–200 watts** of power during sustained effort.  
- **Assuming an average of 150 watts per person:**  
  - Power per person: **150 W**  
  - For 5 people: **150 W × 5 = 750 W**
- **Energy generated per day (in joules):**  
  - Power × time = Energy  
  - Time: 1 hour = 3,600 seconds
  \text{Energy} = 750\, \text{W} \times 3,600\, \text{s} = 2,700,000\, \text{J}
- **Convert joules to watt-hours:**  
  1\, \text{Wh} = 3,600\, \text{J}
  \text{Energy in Wh} = \frac{2,700,000\, \text{J}}{3,600\, \text{J/Wh}} \approx 750\, \text{Wh}
**Result:** The 5 people can generate approximately **750 Wh** of energy per day.
### Step 2: Determine the energy needed to charge an iPhone 14
- **Battery capacity of iPhone 14:** Approximately **3,279 mAh** at **3.81 V**.
  \text{Battery capacity in Wh} = \text{mAh} \times \text{V} / 1,000
  3,279\, \text{mAh} \times 3.81\, \text{V} / 1,000 \approx 12.49\, \text{Wh}
**Result:** Charging one iPhone 14 fully requires about **12.5 Wh**.
### Step 3: Calculate how many iPhones can be charged with the generated energy
\text{Number of iPhones} = \frac{\text{Total energy generated}}{\text{Energy per iPhone}}
= \frac{750\, \text{Wh}}{12.5\, \text{Wh}} = 60

These vitamins are stored in the body's fat tissues and liver, and taking them in high doses over a long period can lead to toxicity, a condition known as hypervitaminosis.
**Examples of relevant findings include:**
1. **Vitamin A Toxicity:**  
   Chronic high intake of vitamin A has been associated with liver damage, increased intracranial pressure, and bone abnormalities. Some studies and case reports have documented liver enzyme elevations and liver injury related to vitamin A overdose. For example, excessive use of retinoids (a form of vitamin A) used in acne treatment can cause hepatotoxicity.
2. **Vitamin D Excess:**  
   Over-supplementation with vitamin D can lead to vitamin D toxicity, characterized by hypercalcemia, which may cause liver damage, kidney problems, and cardiovascular issues. Long-term high doses can strain the liver and other organs.
3. **Epidemiological Studies and Reviews:**  
   A systematic review published in the *Journal of Clinical Medicine* (2020) discusses risks associated with high-dose vitamin supplementation, emphasizing that prolonged intake beyond recommended levels can lead to toxicity and organ damage.
**Important considerations:**
- **Dosage matters:** The recommended daily allowances (RDAs) are generally safe for most people when followed.
- **Individual health factors:** Pre-existing liver conditions, medications, and other health factors can influence risk.
- **Supplement quality:** Unregulated or poorly manufactured supplements may carry additional risks.
**Conclusion:**  
While vitamins are essential for health, excessive long-term supplementation—especially of fat-soluble vitamins—is linked to potential organ harm, including liver toxicity. It’s always advisable to consult healthcare professionals before starting or continuing high-dose vitamin regimens.
If you are concerned about vitamin use or liver health, discuss with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and to evaluate your specific health needs.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":376,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2231,""usageInWh"":0.51983}","d185440a-f11d-47de-ba15-d091b8ce7c08","57d3c344f9064581b9a4cf65dded0fce","2025-06-26T19:31:01.799887Z","rdhqALeKrF5MAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5MAQAAAAAAAA==/","""7c013622-0000-1600-0000-685da0110000""","attachments/","1750966289"

You'll need to convert the arrays to sequences using `Enumerable` features, or use other methods such as `Array.Copy`. Here's an example using LINQ and another using `Array.Copy`:
### Using LINQ
You can concatenate multiple arrays using LINQ like this:
using System.Linq;
        int[] array1 = { 1, 2, 3 };
        int[] array2 = { 4, 5, 6 };
        int[] array3 = { 7, 8, 9 };
        // Using LINQ
        int[] concatenatedArray = array1.Concat(array2).Concat(array3).ToArray();
        // Print the concatenated array
        Console.WriteLine(string.Join("", "", concatenatedArray));
### Using `Array.Copy`
Another way is to use `Array.Copy` to manually copy each array into a new larger array:
        // Create a new array to hold all elements
        int[] concatenatedArray = new int[array1.Length + array2.Length + array3.Length];
        // Copy each array into the new array
        Array.Copy(array1, 0, concatenatedArray, 0, array1.Length);
        Array.Copy(array2, 0, concatenatedArray, array1.Length, array2.Length);
        Array.Copy(array3, 0, concatenatedArray, array1.Length + array2.Length, array3.Length);
Both methods will give you the concatenation result of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. Choose the approach that you find most intuitive or that fits better with your application's requirements.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":9,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1838,""usageInWh"":0.96891}","671836f5-34b6-42a4-a191-8fe2a3420970","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-27T07:27:32.8845095Z","rdhqALeKrF5PAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5PAQAAAAAAAA==/","""8b012caf-0000-1600-0000-685e47f60000""","attachments/","1751009270"

However, you can still achieve similar functionality using LINQ or other methods, but with a bit more verbosity.
However, from C# 7 onwards, you have access to features like `params` arrays for method arguments, but not directly for array concatenation like you do with spread syntax. There's no built-in, syntactical sugar specifically for spreading or concatenating arrays in the way JavaScript/TypeScript provides.
If you really want more of a ""syntactic sugar"" feel, you could define a helper function to concatenate arrays, or use libraries that might provide such utility methods. Here’s how you could define a helper function that uses `params`:
        // Using helper method
        int[] concatenatedArray = ConcatenateArrays(array1, array2, array3);
    static T[] ConcatenateArrays<T>(params T[][] arrays)
        return arrays.SelectMany(array => array).ToArray();
In this example, the `ConcatenateArrays` method uses `params` to receive a variable number of arrays and flattens them into one using `SelectMany`, which is quite similar in spirit to working with spread syntax.
While this doesn't give you the exact syntax as TypeScript, it's a more idiomatic way in C# to achieve similar results with a concise helper function.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":504,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1783,""usageInWh"":1.02501}","7d4669bf-8255-4e53-9dd0-2ba9018f93e9","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-27T07:28:09.7396765Z","rdhqALeKrF5QAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5QAQAAAAAAAA==/","""92016b56-0000-1600-0000-685e7a310000""","attachments/","1751022129"

Hier einige wichtige Punkte dazu:
1. **Ziel und Inhalte des Jugend- und Sport-Expertenkurses:**  
   Dieser Kurs ist meist auf Fachkompetenz im Jugend- und Sportbereich ausgerichtet, etwa auf die Planung, Durchführung und Reflexion von Aktivitäten in diesen Bereichen. Er vermittelt Kenntnisse in Pädagogik, Organisation und Methodik, die in der Jugendarbeit und im Sport relevant sind.
2. **Was ist das SVEB-Zertifikat?**  
   Das Zertifikat für Erwachsenenbildnerinnen und -bildner (bei Swiss Voluntary Education Badge, SVEB) ist eine Qualifikation für die Erwachsenenbildung und basiert auf einem umfassenden Kompetenzrahmen. Es erfordert meist eine bestimmte Anzahl an Theorie- und Praxiseinheiten sowie eine Abschlussarbeit oder Prüfung.
3. **Vereinfachung durch den Jugend- und Sport-Expertenkurs:**  
   Manche Weiterbildungsangebote im Sport- und Jugendbereich können gewisse Kurse oder Module des SVEB-Qualifikationsrahmens abdecken oder ergänzen. Es gibt allerdings keine automatische Anerkennung des SVEB-Zertifikats nur durch den Besuch eines Jugend- und Sport-Expertenkurses.
4. **Mögliche Wege zur Vereinfachung:**  
   - **Anrechnung von Kursen:** Falls der Jugend- und Sport-Expertenkurs thematisch teilweise mit den SVEB-Anforderungen übereinstimmt, kann es je nach Bildungseinrichtung zu einer Anrechnung von Teilen der Weiterbildung kommen. Dies ist jedoch eher die Ausnahme als die Regel und bedarf einer individuellen Anerkennung.
   - **Impuls für die SVEB-Qualifizierung:** Der Kurs kann eine solide Vorbereitung sein, um später die Anforderungen des SVEB-Kurses zu erfüllen, insbesondere wenn er pädagogische und methodische Kompetenzen beinhaltet.
   - **Aufbau auf vorhandene Qualifikationen:** Wenn Sie bereits erwachsene Pädagogik- oder Lehrkompetenzen haben, kann der Jugend- und Sport-Expertenkurs Ihre Fähigkeiten ergänzen und den Weg zur SVEB-Zertifizierung erleichtern.
5. **Fazit:**  
   Der Jugend- und Sport-Expertenkurs kann Ihre Kompetenz im Bereich der Erwachsenenbildung erweitern und Sie auf die SVEB-Qualifikation vorbereiten. Eine direkte, vereinfachte Erlangung des SVEB-Zertifikats durch diesen Kurs ist jedoch in der Regel nicht möglich, sondern eher ein Schritt auf dem Weg dorthin. Für eine genaue Einschätzung empfiehlt es sich, mit einer anerkannten Weiterbildungseinrichtung oder mit der Organisation, die das SVEB-Zertifikat vergibt, Kontakt aufzunehmen.
Der Jugend- und Sport-Expertenkurs ist eine wertvolle Ergänzung, kann aber in der Regel keine automatische oder stark vereinfachte Erlangung des SVEB-Zertifikats bewirken. Er dient vielmehr als Vorbereitung und Ergänzung im Rahmen der Erwachsenenbildung.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":22,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2956,""usageInWh"":0.6473}","22b47988-70c9-4934-9bfa-1b9f4a4999c5","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-27T07:57:13.1393852Z","rdhqALeKrF5RAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5RAQAAAAAAAA==/","""8c01c89a-0000-1600-0000-685e4ef20000""","attachments/","1751011058"

Here are some considerations for each approach:
### Shared Kernel
**Advantages:**
1. **Consistency:** A shared kernel can ensure that all modules have consistent definitions and behaviors for common entities, which can reduce discrepancies and bugs.
2. **Reduced Duplication:** Centralizing common logic and data models can reduce redundancy across components, making maintenance simpler.
3. **Ease of Use:** Developers might find it easier to work with in-process calls than with network-based ones, as they don't have to deal with serialization, communication protocols, etc.
**Disadvantages:**
1. **Tight Coupling:** All modules depend on a single shared kernel, leading to tight coupling. Changes to the kernel can require simultaneous changes in dependent modules.
2. **Reduced Modularity:** It can blur the boundaries between modules, hindering clear separation of concerns.
3. **Scalability:** As the size of the shared kernel grows, it can become a bottleneck for development, making scaling harder.
### Component-to-Component API-Based Communication
1. **Loose Coupling:** Components are more self-contained and interact through well-defined interfaces, which promotes independence and clear boundaries.
2. **Flexibility:** Each component can evolve independently as long as it maintains its API contracts.
3. **Decoupled Deployment:** Potentially allows deploying parts of the system independently, which can be a step toward microservices if desired in the future.
1. **Complexity:** Introducing network-based communication can increase complexity, such as dealing with latency, network failures, and contract management.
2. **Performance:** API-based communication might introduce overhead due to serialization/deserialization and network latency.
3. **Consistency Assurance:** Ensuring data consistency across components can be more challenging compared to using a shared kernel.
- **Use a Shared Kernel** if you need simplicity and strong consistency across modules, and if you are confident that the shared kernel won't grow into a bottleneck.
- **Use Component-to-Component API Communication** if you prefer flexibility, loose coupling, and are considering evolving towards a microservices architecture.
Ultimately, you might find a hybrid approach beneficial, where a minimal shared kernel is used for very basic shared logic or entities while employing component API communication for more complex interactions. Your choice should align with your team's expertise, the system's complexity, and future scaling plans.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":68,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2852,""usageInWh"":1.49608}","af8c8e9a-9f52-43d8-b0d4-59d35dc4d7b6","e6c6fdc37f5247779986718dd20d086e","2025-06-27T10:52:11.0791886Z","rdhqALeKrF5WAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5WAQAAAAAAAA==/","""92010412-0000-1600-0000-685e78240000""","attachments/","1751021604"

**Bedeutung des Rebalancing:**
- **Risikokontrolle:** Durch das Rebalancing wird verhindert, dass einzelne Asset-Klassen, z. B. Aktien oder Anleihen, exponentiell an Gewicht gewinnen oder verlieren, was das Risiko unkontrolliert erhöht.
- **Robiustheit der Anlagestrategie:** Es stellt sicher, dass die ursprüngliche Investmentstrategie eingehalten wird, auch beiMarktschwankungen.
- **Risiko- und Renditeoptimierung:** Das Rebalancing hilft, das Verhältnis zwischen Risiko und Rendite gemäß der Zielsetzung zu wahren.
**Fokuspunkte bei Rebalancing:**
- **Begrenzung der Aktienquote:** Eine zu hohe Aktienquote kann das Portfolio anfälliger für Marktschwankungen machen. Das Rebalancing sorgt dafür, dass die Aktienquote im Zielbereich bleibt, um das Risiko zu kontrollieren.
- **Kostenkontrolle:** Zu häufiges Rebalancing kann Transaktionskosten verursachen. Die Wahl des Rebalancing-Intervalls (z. B. halbjährlich, quarterly oder bei Überschreitung eines bestimmten Schwellenwerts) sollte daher strategisch erfolgen.
- **Steuerliche Überlegungen:** In manchen Steuerrechtssystemen kann Rebalancing zu steuerpflichtigen Ereignissen führen. Dies gilt es bei der Planung zu berücksichtigen.
- **Zeitpunkt und Marktgegebenheiten:** Manche Vermögensverwalter verwenden eine sogenannte ""Schwellenstrategie"", bei der nur dann rebalanciert wird, wenn die Asset-Allokation eine bestimmte Abweichung vom Zielwert überschreitet.
**Fazit:**
Regelmäßiges Rebalancing ist ein zentrales Instrument, um das Portfolio auf Kurs zu halten, Risiken zu steuern und die langfristigen Anlageziele zu sichern. Dabei gilt es, eine Balance zwischen Risikoüberwachung, Kostenmanagement und steuerlichen Aspekten zu finden.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":47,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1913,""usageInWh"":0.43002}","661e9920-3087-4540-833d-f3abcb1c3c44","a31b03cff7ce4570a611100887b0c69f","2025-06-27T12:06:11.2188986Z","rdhqALeKrF5ZAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5ZAQAAAAAAAA==/","""94014d4e-0000-1600-0000-685e895f0000""","attachments/","1751026015"

It is a massive, glowing sphere of hot gases, primarily hydrogen and helium, that produces light and heat essential for life on Earth.
**What is the Sun?**  
The Sun is a colossal ball of plasma—superheated, ionized gases held together by gravity. It is classified as a G-type main-sequence star (G dwarf), roughly 4.6 billion years old, and about 109 times wider than Earth. The Sun's gravity keeps the planets, asteroids, comets, and other objects orbiting around it.
**Why is the Sun burning?**  
The Sun isn’t “burning” in the way a fire burns with flames; instead, it produces energy through a process called **nuclear fusion**. In the Sun's core, the intense pressure and temperature (around 15 million degrees Celsius) cause hydrogen nuclei to fuse together, forming helium nuclei. This fusion releases an enormous amount of energy in the form of light and heat.
This nuclear fusion process is what powers the Sun and provides the energy that sustains life on Earth. It has been ongoing for billions of years and will continue for billions more until the Sun exhausts its hydrogen fuel.
**In summary:**  
- The Sun is a massive, glowing ball of plasma powered by nuclear fusion.  
- It ""burns"" not with fire, but through fusion reactions converting hydrogen into helium, releasing energy that heats the Sun and radiates outward.

Here's how it works:
**Gravitational Attraction:**  
The Moon's gravity exerts a force on the Earth. This force pulls on the water in the oceans, causing it to be pulled toward the Moon. This creates a **tidal bulge** on the side of Earth facing the Moon.
**Tidal Bulges and High Tides:**  
There are actually two main areas of higher water levels:  
1. **On the side of Earth closest to the Moon:** The gravitational pull is strongest, pulling water toward the Moon and creating a high tide.  
2. **On the opposite side of Earth:** Due to the inertia of water (the tendency of water to resist changes in motion), a second high tide occurs away from the Moon.
**Low Tides:**  
Between these two bulges, the water level is lower, resulting in low tides.
**Why Do Tides Vary?**  
- **Position of the Moon:** As the Moon orbits Earth, the position of these bulges changes, causing the timing of high and low tides.  
- **Sun's Role:** The Sun's gravity also affects tides, though less strongly than the Moon. When the Sun, Moon, and Earth align ( during full and new moons), we experience higher (spring) tides. When they form a right angle ( during quarter moons), we get lower (neap) tides.
**In short:**  
The Moon’s gravity creates a pull on Earth's oceans, leading to the rise and fall of sea levels—known as tides. The gravitational interaction causes water to be pulled toward the Moon, forming a bulge that we experience as a high tide, while the opposite side also experiences a high tide due to inertia, with low tides occurring between these bulges.

   The Sun constantly emits a stream of charged particles called the solar wind. These particles are mostly electrons and protons.
2. **Interaction with Earth's Magnetosphere:**  
   When the solar wind reaches Earth, it interacts with Earth's magnetic field (magnetosphere).  
   - The Earth's magnetic field directs many of these particles toward the poles, near the magnetic field lines.

   As the charged particles travel along magnetic field lines toward the polar regions, they collide with gases in the Earth's upper atmosphere, mainly oxygen and nitrogen.
4. **Energy Release as Light:**  
   These collisions transfer energy to atmospheric gases, exciting the atoms and molecules. When they return to their normal state, they emit light — creating the shimmering displays of colorful lights we see as auroras.
5. **Colors of the Aurora:**  
   - **Green:** Most common, caused by oxygen molecules about 60 miles above the surface.  
   - **Red:** Less common, caused by oxygen higher in the atmosphere.  
   - **Purple and blue:** Often caused by nitrogen molecules.
Polar lights occur because solar wind particles interact with Earth's magnetic field and atmospheric gases at the poles, producing spectacular light displays through a process called **electromagnetic excitation**.

Here's a broad overview of its key concepts and principles:
### Key Concepts of Quantum Physics
1. **Wave-Particle Duality:**  
   Particles such as electrons and photons (light particles) exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This means that, under certain conditions, they can behave like waves (exhibiting interference and diffraction) and under other conditions like discrete particles.
2. **Quantization:**  
   Many properties, such as energy, are quantized, meaning they can only take on certain discrete values. For example, electrons in an atom occupy specific energy levels, and they cannot exist in between these levels.
3. **Uncertainty Principle:**  
   Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that it is impossible to know both the exact position and exact momentum of a particle simultaneously. The more precisely we know one, the less precisely we can know the other. This principle has profound implications for determinism in physics.
4. **Superposition:**  
   In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in a combination of multiple states at the same time. For instance, an electron can be in a superposition of being in two different locations until it is measured. Upon measurement, it ""collapses"" into one of the possible states.
5. **Entanglement:**  
   Particles can become entangled, which means the state of one particle is directly related to the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. Measuring one particle will affect the state of the other instantaneously. This phenomenon puzzled even Einstein, who famously referred to it as ""spooky action at a distance.""
6. **Quantum Tunneling:**  
   Particles can sometimes pass through barriers that, according to classical physics, they should not be able to cross due to insufficient energy. This occurs because of the wave-like nature of particles and their probability distributions.
7. **Probability and the Wave Function:**  
   The state of a quantum system is described by a mathematical function called the wave function. The wave function provides information about the probability of finding a particle in a particular position and state when measured.
### Applications of Quantum Physics
Quantum mechanics is foundational for many technologies and scientific advancements, including:
- **Semiconductors** and modern electronics (e.g., transistors, diodes).
- **Lasers**, which rely on quantum principles of stimulated emission.
- **Quantum computing**, which utilizes superposition and entanglement for processing information.
- **Quantum cryptography**, providing potentially secure communication methods.
Quantum physics describes the fundamental behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, challenging classical intuitions and offering insights into the nature of reality. Its principles have led to groundbreaking advancements in technology and continue to fascinate scientists and philosophers alike.

It's one of the four fundamental forces in the universe, alongside electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force. Gravity affects everything with mass and governs how objects fall toward each other and how celestial bodies like planets and stars orbit each other. There are two main theories that explain gravity: Newton's law of universal gravitation and Einstein's general theory of relativity.
### Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
Formulated by Isaac Newton in the 17th century, this theory describes gravity as a force that acts between two masses. The key points are:
- **Attractive Force:** Gravity is always attractive, pulling masses toward each other.
- **Proportional to Mass:** The gravitational force is directly proportional to the product of the two masses. This means that larger masses exert a stronger gravitational pull.
- **Inverse-Square Law:** The force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the centers of the two masses. This means that as the distance between the objects increases, the gravitational force decreases rapidly.
The formula for gravitational force is:
\[ F = G \frac{m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2} \]
where \( F \) is the gravitational force, \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses, and \( r \) is the distance between the centers of the two masses.
### Einstein's General Theory of Relativity
Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, published in 1915, provides a more comprehensive explanation of gravity, particularly useful for describing massive objects and large-scale structures like planets, stars, and galaxies. Here are the core concepts:
- **Space-Time Fabric:** Einstein proposed that gravity is not a force transmitted through space but a curvature of space-time caused by mass. Objects with mass, like planets and stars, warp the fabric of space-time, creating curves.
- **Curved Paths:** Objects (including light) move along these curved paths, which appear to us as gravitational attraction. The more massive an object, the more it distorts space-time, and the stronger the gravitational effect.
- **Equivalence Principle:** The effects of gravity and acceleration are locally indistinguishable. This principle led to the understanding that free-falling objects experience no gravitational force because they move along natural paths in curved space-time.
Gravity, in essence, is both a fundamental force in classical physics described by Newton and a geometric property of space-time in general relativity. It governs the movement of everything from falling apples to the trajectories of planets, influencing the structure and behavior of the universe at all scales.

1. **Increase Ventilation:**
   - Open windows and doors to allow fresh air to circulate.
   - Use exhaust fans in bathrooms, kitchens, and laundry areas to vent moisture outside.
2. **Use Dehumidifiers:**
   - Employ a portable dehumidifier to actively remove excess moisture from the air.
3. **Air Conditioning:**
   - If you have an air conditioner, it can help lower humidity levels as it cools the air.
4. **Fix Leaks and Dry Damp Areas:**
   - Repair any leaks in plumbing or walls.
   - Dry out damp clothes, towels, or other materials promptly.
5. **Reduce Moisture Sources:**
   - Avoid drying laundry indoors if possible.
   - Cover pots when cooking to prevent steam escape.
   - Limit humidifying appliances or activities that produce moisture without proper ventilation.
6. **Use Moisture Absorbers:**
   - Place silica gel, activated charcoal, or commercial moisture absorbers in areas prone to dampness.
7. **Maintain Proper Insulation and Seal Gaps:**
   - Properly insulate walls and seal gaps around windows and doors to prevent humidity from entering.
If high humidity persists despite these measures, consider consulting a professional to assess for potential underlying issues like leaks or poor ventilation systems.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":94,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1519,""usageInWh"":0.35057}","155a362b-65f3-4c87-8b27-94e7c849cbc9","90d6086d99f54dbaa068194917cd7aa7","2025-06-27T14:04:09.0295985Z","rdhqALeKrF5wAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5wAQAAAAAAAA==/","""97010fa4-0000-1600-0000-685ea4f40000""","attachments/","1751033076"

Es gibt verschiedene Arten von Herdplatten, aber hier sind die grundlegenden Funktionsweisen der gängigsten Typen:
1. **Elektrische Herdplatten:**
   - **Gusseisenplatten:** Diese bestehen aus einem massiven Gusseisenmaterial, das Strom durchfließen lässt und dadurch Wärme erzeugt. Sie benötigen eine gewisse Zeit, um sich aufzuheizen, speichern aber die Wärme gut und geben sie gleichmäßig ab.
   - **Ceranfeld:** Diese Art von Herdplatte hat eine glatte Glasoberfläche, unter der sich Heizspiralen oder -platten befinden. Wenn die Elektrizität durch die Spiralen fließt, werden sie heiß und erwärmen das Ceranfeld, das wiederum die Topfböden erwärmt. Ceranfelder haben oft eine schnellere Reaktionszeit als Gusseisenplatten.
2. **Induktionsherd:**
   - Diese funktionieren etwas anders als die herkömmlichen elektrischen Herdplatten. Induktionsherde erzeugen ein magnetisches Feld, das direkt mit ferromagnetischen Materialien in den Töpfen und Pfannen interagiert. Die erzeugte Energie erhitzt nur das Kochgeschirr und nicht die Herdplatte selbst, was zu einer höheren Effizienz und schnelleren Kochzeiten führt. Induktionsherde benötigen spezielle Töpfe und Pfannen, die magnetisch sind.
3. **Gasherd:**
   - Bei Gasherden wird Gas (z.B. Erdgas oder Propan) durch eine Düse geleitet und entzündet. Die Flamme erhitzt den Topfboden direkt. Gasherde bieten den Vorteil einer sofortigen Temperaturregelung und visualisieren die Hitzequelle.
Insgesamt nutzen alle Herdplattentypen die Grundprinzipien der Thermodynamik, um Wärme zu erzeugen und diese Wärme auf die Töpfe und Pfannen zu übertragen, um Lebensmittel zu kochen. Zu beachten ist, dass unterschiedliche Herdarten unterschiedliche Vor- und Nachteile in Bezug auf Effizienz, Sicherheit und Kochverhalten mit sich bringen.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":6,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1909,""usageInWh"":0.6033}","1882ff83-eda9-4835-bfdc-fdcbe725a618","bf0bc8a3dade408a906a467797eb0563","2025-06-28T10:47:22.2513951Z","rdhqALeKrF5xAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5xAQAAAAAAAA==/","""04005bcd-0000-1600-0000-685fc8540000""","attachments/","1751107668"

Hier sind die grundlegenden Schritte, wie ein Kühlschrank arbeitet:
1. **Kältemittelzirkulation:**
   - Der Kühlschrank enthält ein Kältemittel, das durch einen geschlossenen Kreislauf zirkuliert. Dieses Kältemittel hat eine niedrige Siedepunkt-Temperatur, was bedeutet, dass es bei relativ niedrigen Temperaturen verdampfen kann.
2. **Verdampfung:**
   - Im Inneren des Kühlschranks, im sogenannten Verdampfer, verdampft das flüssige Kältemittel und nimmt dabei Wärme aus dem Innenraum auf. Dadurch wird die Temperatur im Kühlschrank gesenkt. Das Kältemittel geht bei dieser Umwandlung von flüssig zu gasförmig.
3. **Kompression:**
   - Das gasförmige Kältemittel wird dann durch einen Kompressor angesaugt, der es komprimiert. Beim Komprimieren steigt der Druck und die Temperatur des Kältemittels an.
4. **Kondensation:**
   - Das heiße, komprimierte Gas wird in den Kondensator geleitet, der sich normalerweise an der Rückseite oder der Unterseite des Kühlschranks befindet. Hier wird das Kältemittel durch die umgebende Luft gekühlt und kondensiert wieder zu einer Flüssigkeit. Bei diesem Prozess gibt das Kältemittel die aufgenommene Wärme an die Umgebung ab.
5. **Expansion:**
   - Das flüssige Kältemittel fließt dann durch ein Expansionsventil oder einen Kapillarrohr, wo es sich entspannt und wieder in einen Niederdruckzustand übergeht. Dies führt dazu, dass das Kältemittel erneut kaltes, niedrigdruckflüssiges Kältemittel bildet.
6. **Wiederholung des Zyklus:**
   - Der Zyklus wiederholt sich, indem das Kältemittel wieder in den Verdampfer gelangt, wo es erneut Wärme aus dem Inneren des Kühlschranks aufnimmt.
Durch die kontinuierliche Zirkulation des Kältemittels wird die Temperatur im Inneren des Kühlschranks niedrig gehalten, was eine sichere Lagerung von Lebensmitteln ermöglicht. Kühlschränke sind in der Regel so konzipiert, dass sie eine konstante Temperatur zwischen 1 °C und 5 °C aufrechterhalten, um das Wachstum von Bakterien und die Verderblichkeit von Lebensmitteln zu minimieren.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":458,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2209,""usageInWh"":0.7385}","3667fe3d-8bd5-47d4-84a8-aa8a097ca7be","bf0bc8a3dade408a906a467797eb0563","2025-06-28T10:48:03.8688543Z","rdhqALeKrF5yAQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF5yAQAAAAAAAA==/","""040006ce-0000-1600-0000-685fc8700000""","attachments/","1751107696"

Here's why:
1. **Flow Representation**: A Sankey diagram is specifically designed to show flows and is ideal for illustrating the transitions from one state to another, such as from one page to another in a user journey.
2. **Visual Clarity**: It clearly displays the magnitude of flows (or clicks and transitions in your case) using the width of the arrows or bands, making it easy to compare different paths.
3. **Complex Journeys**: It's particularly useful for complex journeys with multiple branches, as it can concisely represent multiple paths and their interactions.
4. **Interactivity**: Highcharts offers interactivity features, such as tooltips and clickable elements, which can enhance the exploration of user journeys.
To create a Sankey diagram in Highcharts, you would need to structure your data to reflect the source (starting page) and target (following page) along with the value (number of clicks or transitions) for each connection.

Given your current setup with `DbContext` and navigating through relationships with `Include` and `ThenInclude`, here's how you can approach it:
### Using Entity Framework and LINQ
If you're looking to perform this transformation directly with Entity Framework and LINQ, you will need to:
1. **Fetch the Data**: Pull the journeys and associated click events from the database.
2. **Transform the Data**: Map the data into a format that represents the page transitions between clicks.
Here's a general approach using LINQ:
var journeyTransitions = dbContext.AggregatedJourneys
    .Include(x => x.ClickEvents)
    .ThenInclude(x => x.ClickEvent)
    .SelectMany(journey => journey.ClickEvents
        .OrderBy(click => click.Timestamp)
        .Select((click, index) => new
            Source = index == 0 ? ""Start"" : journey.ClickEvents.ElementAt(index - 1).Url,
            Target = click.Url,
            Count = 1 // we'll aggregate this later
        }))
    .ToList();
// Aggregate repeat transitions to get counts for each transition
var aggregatedTransitions = journeyTransitions
    .GroupBy(x => new { x.Source, x.Target })
    .Select(g => new
        Source = g.Key.Source,
        Target = g.Key.Target,
        Count = g.Sum(x => x.Count)
    })
- **SelectMany** is used to flatten each journey with its ordered list of click events.
- **Ordering by Timestamp** ensures that you're mapping the transitions in the order they occurred.
- **Previous Click** is fetched using `ElementAt(index - 1)`, enabling the mapping between consecutive page URLs.
- **GroupBy and Sum** are then used to aggregate the transitions to count how many times each specific transition occurred, which is suitable for a Sankey diagram representation.
### Final Integration into Sankey
Finally, the `aggregatedTransitions` can be serialized into a JSON format suitable for highcharts:
var sankeyData = aggregatedTransitions
    .Select(t => new[] { t.Source, t.Target, t.Count })
    .ToArray();
// Serialize to JSON if needed for highcharts
var jsonSankeyData = JsonSerializer.Serialize(sankeyData);
You can pass `jsonSankeyData` to the front end, where it's used in the Highcharts configuration for your Sankey chart. This approach ensures that most of the heavy lifting is efficiently done on the database side using LINQ and EF, minimizing the amount of data you need to handle in-memory.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":643,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2727,""usageInWh"":1.53008}","3504348d-fb4f-42c2-898d-8fe4b373dead","e6c6fdc37f5247779986718dd20d086e","2025-06-28T20:27:46.7299343Z","rdhqALeKrF56AQAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF56AQAAAAAAAA==/","""0700306c-0000-1600-0000-686050810000""","attachments/","1751142529"

Let me try to assist you differently. If you want to transform user journey data directly using Entity Framework in a way that fits the needs of a Sankey diagram, we should focus on efficiently querying and transforming that data. Here's a refined approach:
### Approach
1. **Fetch Data**: Use EF Core to retrieve the necessary data, ensuring you leverage navigation properties correctly.
2. **Transform Data**: Process the retrieved data to map page transitions between clicks with their counts.
### Example
Let's assume you have an `AggregatedJourney` entity that contains a list of `ClickEventEntity`. Here's how you might approach this task within the constraints of your context:
// First, ensure you have the correct using directives:
// Fetch the journey data, including related click events
    .Include(j => j.ClickEvents)
    .ThenInclude(ce => ce.ClickEvent)
    .SelectMany(j => j.ClickEvents
        .OrderBy(ce => ce.Timestamp)
            Source = index == 0 ? ""Start"" : j.ClickEvents.ElementAt(index - 1).Url,
            Count = 1 // Initial count
// Aggregate the transitions to count the occurrences
        Count = g.Count() // Summing up counts
// Transform into a format suitable for the Sankey diagram in Highcharts
    .Select(t => new object[] { t.Source, t.Target, t.Count })
- **Include and ThenInclude**: These are used to ensure that related `ClickEventEntity` entries are loaded alongside each `AggregatedJourney`.
- **OrderBy**: Ensures that click events are processed in chronological order based on their `Timestamp`.
- **SelectMany and Select**: Create a flattened list of transitions by iterating over each journey's click events.
- **ElementAt**: Used to reference the previous click's URL to form transitions.
- **GroupBy and Count**: Aggregate transitions to count how frequently each path is taken.
- **Formatting for Highcharts**: The final array should be compatible with Highcharts' data input structure for a Sankey diagram.
By following this approach, you can transform and prepare your data for visualization efficiently.
