### Enhanced Suggestions:

1. **Font Fallbacks**: Include fallback fonts in `font-family` settings to ensure compatibility across browsers that may not support certain font types.

2. **Accessibility Check**: Double-check color contrasts to meet accessibility standards, ensuring all elements remain readable against various backgrounds.

3. **Avoid Redundancies**: Simplify font properties to consolidate definitions to reduced property bloat where possible.

4. **Negative Margins**: Re-evaluate the necessity of negative margins which can be tricky and may cause overlapping if not carefully managed.

5. **Units Consistency**: Make sure every dimension has specified units to avoid rendering issues.

Using these enhancements should result in better performance, easier maintenance, and an improved user experience across a variety of displays.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":4324,""numberOfOutputTokens"":5652,""usageInWh"":3.6476}","3e53eda2-ceee-4c4d-985d-c4ad804d115b","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-24T05:49:29.3166489Z","rdhqALeKrF6fAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF6fAAAAAAAAAA==/","""24019967-0000-1600-0000-685a3c7d0000""","attachments/","1750744189"

Here’s a general overview of the potential risks and opportunities associated with art investment:

### Opportunities:

1. **Diversification**: Investing in art can diversify your portfolio, potentially reducing risk if other asset classes (like stocks or bonds) perform poorly.

2. **Appreciation Potential**: Some artworks appreciate significantly over time, offering the potential for high returns on investment.

3. **Cultural and Aesthetic Value**: Investing in art can offer personal satisfaction through ownership of aesthetically pleasing works that can also serve as conversation pieces or status symbols.

4. **Tangible Asset**: Art is a physical asset, which can be appealing in times of economic uncertainty or inflation.

5. **Market Growth**: The global art market has been growing, with increasing interest from high-net-worth individuals, possibly driving up prices and demand.

### Risks:

1. **Valuation Challenges**: Art's value is highly subjective, making it difficult to assess and often less transparent compared to traditional financial assets. 

2. **Liquidity Concerns**: Art is not a liquid asset. It might take time to sell a piece at your desired price, especially if market demand wanes.

3. **High Entry Costs**: Quality artworks can be expensive to acquire, and there are additional costs associated with insurance, storage, and maintenance.

4. **Market Volatility**: The art market can be volatile and influenced by trends, economic conditions, and changes in taste.

5. **Fraud and Authenticity Issues**: There is a risk of fraud, with forgeries being prevalent. Proper provenance and authentication are crucial.

6. **Regulatory and Transaction Costs**: Art transactions may involve substantial fees (commissions, taxes), and buying/selling art could have legal and regulatory implications, especially when dealing internationally.

### Evaluating Partasio.com:

To specifically assess an offer from Partasio.com:

- **Due Diligence**: Investigate the platform's reputation, user reviews, and any regulatory credentials to ensure it is a legitimate and trustworthy service.

- **Understand Their Model**: Evaluate how Partasio.com operates (e.g., fractional ownership, direct sales, auctions) and the fees involved.

- **Transparency**: Ensure they provide clear information on valuations, past performance, and how they assess the authenticity and provenance of artworks.

- **Exit Strategy**: Consider how and when you can sell your investments, and at what cost or potential loss.

- **Legal Considerations**: Check for any legal obligations or restrictions associated with using the platform, especially if dealing internationally.

In summary, while art can be an alluring investment for some, it requires careful analysis and consideration of unique risks. Consulting with a financial advisor or art investment expert might be beneficial to better understand the platform and art market dynamics before committing funds.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":26,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3123,""usageInWh"":1.62715}","c8cd401f-8631-4310-8cf5-077e5179f3ff","a31b03cff7ce4570a611100887b0c69f","2025-06-24T06:24:43.9001366Z","rdhqALeKrF6gAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF6gAAAAAAAAAA==/","""2501913e-0000-1600-0000-685a44f80000""","attachments/","1750746360"

However, many elite climbers tend to be within a certain height range that offers advantages for certain climbing styles.

Generally, competitive lead climbers and sport climbers tend to be around 5'6"" to 5'11"" (168 cm to 180 cm). For example, notable climbers like Adam Ondra (around 5'10"" or 178 cm) and Janja Garnbret (around 5'5"" or 165 cm) fall within or near this range. 

It's important to note that climbing success is highly individual, and climbers of various heights can excel in different disciplines such as bouldering, lead climbing, or speed climbing. Height can influence reach and leverage, but technique, strength-to-weight ratio, and mental skills often matter more.

For elite male long-distance runners (e.g., marathoners and 10,000 meters), the average height is typically around **1.65 to 1.75 meters** (5 feet 5 inches to 5 feet 9 inches). Similarly, top female distance runners tend to be slightly shorter, often around **1.55 to 1.65 meters** (5 feet 1 inch to 5 feet 5 inches).

For sprinters, especially those competing in shorter distances like 100m and 200m, heights are more variable, but many successful sprinters are also within the 1.70 to 1.85 meters range.

**In summary:**
- **Top male distance runners:** approximately **1.65 to 1.75 meters**
- **Top female distance runners:** approximately **1.55 to 1.65 meters**

In dem von Ihnen geschilderten Fall, in dem der Mann in Graubünden (GR) und die Frau in Zürich (ZH) gemeldet sind, ergeben sich folgende steuerliche Konsequenzen:

1. **Steuerdomizil**: 
   - Der Wohnsitz des Mannes ist in Graubünden, daher ist er in erster Linie in diesem Kanton steuerpflichtig.
   - Die Frau hat ihren Wohnsitz in Zürich und ist dort steuerpflichtig.

2. **Gemeinsame Besteuerung von Ehepaaren**: 
   - Ehepaare werden in der Schweiz normalerweise gemeinsam besteuert, und es wird eine gemeinsame Steuererklärung für das Paar erstellt. Der gemeinsame steuerliche Wohnsitz bestimmt, wo die Steuererklärung einzureichen ist und wo die Einkommenssteuerpflicht primär besteht.
   - Dieses gemeinsame Domizil ist in der Regel dort, wo sich der Mittelpunkt der Lebensinteressen des Ehepaars befindet. Dabei werden Aspekte wie familiäre Bindungen, der Ort der Arbeit und andere soziale Verbindungen berücksichtigt.
   - Aufgrund der unterschiedlichen Meldung sind möglicherweise besondere Abklärungen notwendig, um das korrekte bundes- und kantonale Steuerdomizil festzustellen.

3. **Immobilienbesteuerung**:
   - Das Ferienhaus in Graubünden würde auf Kantonsebene in Graubünden besteuert werden, unabhängig davon, wo der steuerliche Wohnsitz des Paares ist. In der Steuererklärung wird der Eigenmietwert dieser Liegenschaft erfasst, und es können kantonale Grundstückswerte oder Vermögenssteuersätze Anwendung finden.
   - Das Eigenheim in Zürich würde in Zürich in der Steuererklärung ebenfalls mit dem Eigenmietwert und dem Immobilienwert berücksichtigt werden.

4. **Steuererklärungen**:
   - Da beide Partner separate Wohnsitze haben, könnte theoretisch die Notwendigkeit bestehen, in beiden Kantonen Steuererklärungen auszufüllen, obwohl normalerweise ein Hauptdomizil definiert werden sollte.
   - Sie sollten sicherstellen, dass sowohl Einkommen und Vermögen als auch die jeweiligen Immobilien in beiden Kantonen korrekt angegeben werden, um Doppelbesteuerungen zu vermeiden.

Es ist ratsam, in solchen komplexen Fällen einen Steuerberater oder Fachperson für Steuerrecht zu konsultieren, um die genaue steuerliche Situation zu klären und um sicherzustellen, dass alle steuerlichen Verpflichtungen korrekt erfüllt werden.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":763,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2381,""usageInWh"":1.37402}","acd59ec7-3b87-4edf-833a-f3ba358a131d","a31b03cff7ce4570a611100887b0c69f","2025-06-24T08:23:45.7862339Z","rdhqALeKrF6oAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF6oAAAAAAAAAA==/","""2801321a-0000-1600-0000-685a60d10000""","attachments/","1750753489"

Es gibt jedoch einige wesentliche Punkte, die beachtet werden müssen, insbesondere wenn ein Ehepartner in Zürich (ZH) und der andere in Graubünden (GR) gemeldet ist.

### Gemeinsame Besteuerung:

1. **Gemeinsames Steuerdomizil:**
   - Obwohl die Ehepartner an unterschiedlichen Orten gemeldet sind, wird ein gemeinsames Steuerdomizil festgelegt, das in der Regel dort ist, wo der Mittelpunkt der Lebensinteressen des Ehepaares liegt. Dies kann der Ort sein, an dem das Paar die meiste Zeit verbringt, oder wo der soziale und wirtschaftliche Lebensmittelpunkt ist.
   - Sollte ein klarer Mittelpunkt nicht feststellbar sein, kann es zu einer Abklärung durch die Steuerbehörden kommen, die solche Fälle individuell prüfen.

2. **Einreichung der Steuererklärung:**
   - Aufgrund der ungetrennten Ehe wird in der Regel nur eine Steuererklärung für das gesamte Ehepaar eingereicht, basierend auf ihrem gemeinsamen Steuerdomizil.
   - Das bedeutet, dass, wenn der Lebensmittelpunkt in Zürich ist, die Steuererklärung dort eingereicht wird, und umgekehrt.

3. **Besteuerung der Immobilien:**
   - Das Ferienhaus in Graubünden muss für die Vermögens- und Einkommenssteuer (Eigenmietwert) in Graubünden deklariert werden.
   - Das Haus in Zürich wird in der Steuererklärung der Wohnkantone gemeldet, wobei Eigentum und eventuelle Hypotheken anteilsmäßig berücksichtigt werden.

### Praktische Schritte:

- **Klärung des Steuerdomizils:** Ermitteln Sie im Dialog mit den Steuerbehörden oder einem Steuerberater, wie das Hauptdomizil anzusetzen ist.
- **Einheitliche Steuererklärung:** Stellen Sie sicher, dass die Steuererklärung alle relevanten Einkünfte und Vermögenswerte beider Partner umfasst.
- **Vermögensdeklaration:** Beide Liegenschaften müssen korrekt in den jeweiligen Kantonen in Bezug auf Steuerwerte angegeben werden.

Bei Unklarheiten oder komplexeren Lebensumständen wird empfohlen, einen Steuerberater zu konsultieren, um sicherzustellen, dass alle steuerlichen Verpflichtungen korrekt und optimal erfüllt werden.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":1302,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2174,""usageInWh"":1.36008}","1fcff637-d095-4a27-b078-754b0420a487","a31b03cff7ce4570a611100887b0c69f","2025-06-24T08:26:38.2496612Z","rdhqALeKrF6pAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF6pAAAAAAAAAA==/","""2801c829-0000-1600-0000-685a61510000""","attachments/","1750753617"

```typescript
public get activeFileCategories(): IFileCategory[] {
    return this._fileCategories.filter(fileCategory => !fileCategory.isDeleted);

### Explanation:
- **Use of `filter`:** The `filter` method iterates through the `_fileCategories` array and creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function (in this case, checking if `isDeleted` is false).
- **Conciseness:** This approach reduces the number of lines of code and improves readability without changing the functionality.

This modification should maintain the same behavior while making the code cleaner and easier to understand.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":65,""numberOfOutputTokens"":863,""usageInWh"":0.2954}","7de2573e-145b-4439-8bd7-151766b28012","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-24T09:32:52.3473924Z","rdhqALeKrF6rAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF6rAAAAAAAAAA==/","""2a01ac10-0000-1600-0000-685a70ca0000""","attachments/","1750757578"

Let's evaluate the code you provided and look for opportunities to improve it further. You've got a getter method that returns an array of file categories that are not deleted. We optimized it using the `filter` method. Since the solution provided earlier is already quite optimized in terms of readability and efficiency using ES6 `filter`, let's consider a more comprehensive approach that could be part of enhancing the overall class design:

Imagine you have an `IFileCategory` interface and a class managing these categories. Here's how you might further enhance the overall design:

### Original Code:
```typescript
public get activeFileCategories(): IFileCategory[] {
    const fileCategories: IFileCategory[] = [];
    for (const fileCategory of this._fileCategories) {
        if (!fileCategory.isDeleted) {
            fileCategories.push(fileCategory);
        }
    }
    return fileCategories;
}
```

### Improved Code with Context:
```typescript
interface IFileCategory {
    isDeleted: boolean;
    // other properties...
}

class FileCategoryManager {
    private _fileCategories: IFileCategory[];

    constructor(fileCategories: IFileCategory[]) {
        this._fileCategories = fileCategories;
    }

    public get activeFileCategories(): IFileCategory[] {
        return this._fileCategories.filter(fileCategory => !fileCategory.isDeleted);
    }

    public addFileCategory(fileCategory: IFileCategory): void {
        this._fileCategories.push(fileCategory);
    }

    public removeFileCategory(index: number): void {
        if (index >= 0 && index < this._fileCategories.length) {
            this._fileCategories.splice(index, 1);
        }
    }
    
    // More methods can be added as needed
}

const fileCategories: IFileCategory[] = [
    { isDeleted: false },
    { isDeleted: true },
    { isDeleted: false },
    // Other file categories...
];

const manager = new FileCategoryManager(fileCategories);
console.log(manager.activeFileCategories);  // Outputs active categories only
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Encapsulation**: By encapsulating operations related to file categories in a `FileCategoryManager` class, you separate concerns and follow good OOP practices.
2. **Methods for Management**: Added methods for adding and removing file categories which make it easier to manage categories through a singular interface.
3. **Constructor Initialization**: Provides a way to initialize the manager with a list of categories, making the class easier to use and test.

This structure not only optimizes the specific getter method but also provides a more robust and extensible way to handle operations on file categories. This leaves the code open for easy additions or modifications, such as new file category operations or validations.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":248,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2787,""usageInWh"":1.49353}","ef3c2bb9-5c43-496d-acec-651baf3a9612","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-24T09:41:35.4084712Z","rdhqALeKrF6sAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF6sAAAAAAAAAA==/","""2a019d51-0000-1600-0000-685a72e30000""","attachments/","1750758115"

1. Use immutable patterns where appropriate.
2. Add better encapsulation: prevent external code from directly mutating the internal list.
3. Use method names that clearly express intent.
4. Add optional properties to `IFileCategory` for extensibility.
5. Include TypeScript best practices like readonly arrays for safe access and more flexible methods like `removeFileCategoryById`.
6. Add some comments for clarity.

Here's the improved version:

```typescript
interface IFileCategory {
    id: string; // Unique identifier for the category
    isDeleted: boolean;
    // other properties...
}

class FileCategoryManager {
    private _fileCategories: IFileCategory[] = [];

            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    // Remove category by ID for safer removal
    public removeFileCategoryById(id: string): boolean {
        const index = this._fileCategories.findIndex(fc => fc.id === id);
        if (index !== -1) {
            this._fileCategories.splice(index, 1);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    // Optionally, get all categories
    public get allFileCategories(): ReadonlyArray<IFileCategory> {
        return this._fileCategories;
    }

    // Set categories (if needed)
    public setFileCategories(categories: IFileCategory[]): void {
        this._fileCategories = [...categories];
    }
}

// Example usage:
const initialCategories: IFileCategory[] = [
    { id: '1', isDeleted: false },
    { id: '2', isDeleted: true },
    { id: '3', isDeleted: false },
];

const manager = new FileCategoryManager(initialCategories);
console.log(manager.activeFileCategories); // Only active categories

// Adding a new category
manager.addFileCategory({ id: '4', isDeleted: false });

// Removing by ID
manager.removeFileCategoryById('2');

```

### Key improvements:
- **Unique identifiers (`id`)** instead of relying on index for removals, which is safer especially if categories might be reordered.
- **Read-only access** to internal array, preventing external mutation.
- **Flexible removal methods**.
- Better constructor initialization.
- Clarified code with comments.

However, I can provide some general information:

**Estimated Energy Consumption per AI Query:**

- Large-scale AI models like GPT-4 are energy-intensive during both training and inference.
- The energy used per individual inference (like this response) can vary depending on factors such as model size, hardware efficiency, data center infrastructure, and workload.

**Approximate Range:**

- Research estimates suggest that generating a single GPT-4 response could consume approximately **0.3 to 1 Wh** (watt-hours) of energy, though this is a rough approximation.
- Smaller models or optimized hardware can significantly reduce this per-query energy.
- The actual energy cost for this specific interaction may be lower or higher depending on the hardware and infrastructure specifics.

**Summary:**

- **Estimated energy for this prompt:** roughly **0.3 to 1 Wh** (very approximate).
- This is comparable to the energy used to power a small LED light for about 10-30 minutes.

*Please note:* Precise measurement would require detailed energy profiling of the data center hardware and infrastructure used, which is proprietary to OpenAI and hosting providers.

This hook ensures that the component's view, including its child views, has been fully initialized before performing any operations like scrolling.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Component

Create a component where you want to implement the scrolling functionality.

### Step 2: Use the `AfterViewInit` Lifecycle Hook

```typescript
import { Component, AfterViewInit, ViewChild, ElementRef } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: `
    <div style=""height: 100vh;"">Scroll Down to See the Element</div>
    <div #scrollToElement style=""height: 100px; background-color: lightblue;"">
      Scroll to this element!
    </div>
    <div style=""height: 100vh;"">Another Section</div>
  `
})
export class MyComponent implements AfterViewInit {
  @ViewChild('scrollToElement') scrollToElement!: ElementRef;

  ngAfterViewInit() {
    this.scrollToElement.nativeElement.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
  }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Import Statements**: Import necessary Angular core features: `Component`, `AfterViewInit`, `ViewChild`, and `ElementRef`.
2. **Component Decorator**: Specify your component's metadata, including the selector and template.
3. **ViewChild**: Use the `@ViewChild` decorator to get a reference to the element you want to scroll to. In this case, we are using a template reference variable, `#scrollToElement`.
4. **AfterViewInit Implementation**: Implement the `ngAfterViewInit` method, which will execute after the component’s view has been fully initialized.
5. **scrollIntoView**: Call the `scrollIntoView()` method on the native element to scroll smoothly to the specified element.

### Step 3: Add Styles (Optional)

Optionally, you can add some CSS styles to better visualize the scrolling effect.

### Step 4: Import Your Component

Make sure to declare your component in the appropriate Angular module file so that it gets compiled and recognized by Angular.

### Bonus: Scroll to a Specific Position

If you want to scroll to a specific offset instead of just to the element, you can use the `window.scrollTo` method:

```typescript
ngAfterViewInit() {
  const elementPosition = this.scrollToElement.nativeElement.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY;
  window.scrollTo({ top: elementPosition, behavior: 'smooth' });
}
```

### Note

- Ensure that you have enough content above the target element if you want to notice the scrolling effect. Otherwise, you may not see the scrolling if the element is already in view.
- Be aware of how many times this method will be called, particularly if the component is being re-rendered frequently, which may lead to unexpected behavior.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":8,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2841,""usageInWh"":0.8831}","b0b33352-4801-476b-badd-4e29f75d076f","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-24T11:33:08.735175Z","rdhqALeKrF65AAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF65AAAAAAAAAA==/","""2d012f7b-0000-1600-0000-685a8d0e0000""","attachments/","1750764814"

","0","gpt-4.1-nano","2","true","2025-06-24T12:00:31.319792Z","In Angular, dynamically loading a component involves creating the component at runtime rather than declaring it statically in the template. This is useful for scenarios like modals, dialogs, or dynamic forms.

### Basic steps to load a component dynamically:

1. **Make sure the component isn't embedded in any template directly**, or declare it in your module's `entryComponents` (Angular < 9) or just in the `declarations` (Angular 9++ with Ivy).

2. **Create a placeholder in your template**, typically with a directive like `ViewContainerRef`.

3. **Use `ComponentFactoryResolver` (Angular < 13)** or directly create a component via `ViewContainerRef.createComponent()` (Angular 13++ where `ComponentFactoryResolver` is deprecated).

---

### Example: Dynamically load a component in Angular 13+

Suppose you have a component called `MyDynamicComponent`.

**1. Create the component**

```typescript
// my-dynamic.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-dynamic',
  template: `<p>This is a dynamic component!</p>`
})
export class MyDynamicComponent {}
```

**2. Prepare a placeholder in your host component**

In your host component's template:

```html
<!-- host.component.html -->
<div>
  <ng-template #container></ng-template>
</div>
<button (click)=""loadComponent()"">Load Dynamic Component</button>
```

Notice the `#container` template reference.

**3. Load the component dynamically in your host component**

```typescript
// host.component.ts
import { Component, ViewChild, ViewContainerRef, AfterViewInit } from '@angular/core';
import { MyDynamicComponent } from './my-dynamic.component';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-host',
  templateUrl: './host.component.html'
})
export class HostComponent {
  @ViewChild('container', { read: ViewContainerRef }) container!: ViewContainerRef;

  loadComponent() {
    // Clear previous components if needed
    this.container.clear();

    // Create the component dynamically
    this.container.createComponent(MyDynamicComponent);
  }
}
```

---

### Important notes:

- **For Angular versions prior to 13:** You often need to use `ComponentFactoryResolver` to resolve and create components.
- **For Angular 13+ with Ivy:** You can directly call `createComponent()` on `ViewContainerRef`.
- **Entry Components:** Angular Ivy (v9+) no longer requires listing entry components explicitly.

---

### Summary:
- Use `ViewChild` to get a `ViewContainerRef`.
- Call `createComponent()` on that `ViewContainerRef`.
- Pass the component class you want to load.

Eine gängige Methode ist die Berechnung der **Bruttorendite** und der **Nettorendite**. 

### 1. Bruttorendite

Die Bruttorendite wird in der Regel auf der Basis des gesamten Mietzinses (oder Gewinns) im Verhältnis zum Verkehrswert der Liegenschaft berechnet:

\[
\text{Bruttorendite} = \left( \frac{\text{Jahresgewinn}}{\text{Verkehrswert der Liegenschaft}} \right) \times 100
\]

Wenn wir die Werte aus deinen Angaben verwenden:

- **Jahresgewinn**: CHF 123'000
- **Verkehrswert der Liegenschaft**: CHF 2'500'000 bis CHF 3'000'000

#### Berechnung der Bruttorendite:

1. **Für die Untergrenze (2.5 Mio)**:

\[
\text{Bruttorendite} = \left( \frac{123'000}{2'500'000} \right) \times 100 \approx 4.92\%
\]

2. **Für die Obergrenze (3 Mio)**:

\[
\text{Bruttorendite} = \left( \frac{123'000}{3'000'000} \right) \times 100 \approx 4.10\%
\]

### 2. Nettorendite

Die Nettorendite berechnet sich, nachdem man alle Betriebskosten und mögliche Hypothekarzinsen vom Gewinn abgezogen hat. Es ist wichtig, diese Kosten zu berücksichtigen, um eine genauere Vorstellung von der tatsächlichen Rendite zu erhalten.

Angenommen, es gibt Betriebskosten und Zinsen, die den Gewinn beeinflussen, die echte Nettorendite könnte als:

\[
\text{Nettorendite} = \left( \frac{\text{Reingewinn}}{\text{Eigenkapital}} \right) \times 100
\]

### Eigenkapital

Das Eigenkapital (EK) lässt sich aus dem Verkehrswert und dem Fremdkapital (FK) berechnen:

\[
EK = \text{Verkehrswert} - \text{Fremdkapital} = 2'500'000 \text{ bis } 3'000'000 - 2'000'000
\]

- **Für die Untergrenze (2.5 Mio)**: 
  - \( EK = 2'500'000 - 2'000'000 = 500'000 \)
  
- **Für die Obergrenze (3 Mio)**: 
  - \( EK = 3'000'000 - 2'000'000 = 1'000'000 \)

### Beispiel für Nettorendite (ohne zusätzliche Informationen zu Betriebskosten):

Wenn es keine weiteren Kosten zu berücksichtigen gibt, bleibt der Gewinn CHF 123'000. Wir nehmen beide Szenarien für das Eigenkapital:

1. **Für 2.5 Mio (Eigenkapital 500'000)**:

\[
\text{Nettorendite} = \left( \frac{123'000}{500'000} \right) \times 100 \approx 24.6\%
\]

2. **Für 3.0 Mio (Eigenkapital 1'000'000)**:

\[
\text{Nettorendite} = \left( \frac{123'000}{1'000'000} \right) \times 100 \approx 12.3\%
\]

### Fazit

- Die **Bruttorendite** liegt zwischen etwa 4.1% und 4.9%, was für Immobilien durchschnittlich ist.
- Die **Nettorendite** kann stark variieren, abhängig von den tatsächlichen Betriebskosten. Sie kann hohe Werte erreichen (24.6% für das niedrigere Eigenkapital), wenn sehr wenig Fremdkapital benötigt wird im Verhältnis zum Gewinn.

Für eine genaue Beurteilung sollte auch die Marktlage, das Risiko, die Lage der Liegenschaft und alle laufenden Kosten berücksichtigt werden. Ein Immobilienexperte könnte hier weitere wertvolle Einsichten geben.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":1632,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2849,""usageInWh"":1.0479}","8f640e4d-e5a3-4820-9c38-56b223b14974","a31b03cff7ce4570a611100887b0c69f","2025-06-24T12:51:26.4071381Z","rdhqALeKrF69AAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF69AAAAAAAAAA==/","""2f0174b5-0000-1600-0000-685a9f600000""","attachments/","1750769504"

For The WORD And For The Testimony Of JesusChrist- Rev 1:9” India Missions
UPDATE MAY-JUNE 2025

Greetings to you all in the precious name of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
The new academic year has begun for the kids at the orphanage.
Please pray for this humble ministry that has faced tremendous hardship and local
society resistance.
Every year as the rains lash, our old structures continually suffer water seepage and
leaks needing annual maintenance.
Over the years this outreach has helped many kids grow in the knowledge of our Lord
Jesus Christ in His saving faith and have started churches across India. As God enables
me, I shall share success stories so it may encourage you all .
“The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: Thy mercy, O LORD, endureth
for ever: Forsake not the works of thine own hands.”

God provides literature for Distribution in Chennai to 200 missionaries working in
the villages.

Dad and Titus Travelled to a nearby village near Hassan to minister and also help
with clothing for the local missionaries

As God provides, we continue to help the needy with
monthly ration supplies to single elderly women in need.
These precious lives, once abandoned, have found
solace in His grace. As it is written:
“for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was
thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and
ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick,
and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto
me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying,
Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee?
or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a
stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed
thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and
came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say
unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye
have done it unto one of the least of these my
brethren, ye have done it unto me.”
Matthew 25:35-40 KJV
“Pure religion and undefiled before God and the
Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in
their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from
the world.”
James 1:27 KJV

Thank you so much for standing by us in prayer and support so we could honor His
Love sharing the Gospel alongside.
By faith, we prepare for the medical outreach in the first week of July.
Will update further.
The vehicles are needing some maintenance and insurance; we are getting them fixed

AKTUALISIERUNG MAI-JUNI 2025

Grüße an euch alle im kostbaren Namen unseres Herrn und Erlösers Jesus Christus. Das neue Schuljahr hat für die Kinder im Waisenhaus begonnen. Bitte betet für diesen demütigen Dienst, der mit enormen Schwierigkeiten und Widerstand in der lokalen Gesellschaft konfrontiert war. Jedes Jahr, wenn der Regen niederprasselt, erleiden unsere alten Gebäude weiterhin Wassereinbrüche und Lecks, die jährliche Wartung erfordern.

Im Laufe der Jahre hat diese Outreach viele Kinder im Wissen unseres Herrn Jesus Christus in seinem rettenden Glauben wachsen lassen und Kirchen in ganz Indien gegründet. Wie Gott es ermöglicht, werde ich Erfolgsgeschichten teilen, um euch alle zu ermutigen. 

„Der HERR wird alles für mich vollbringen. HERR, deine Gnade währt ewig. Lass nicht die Werke deiner Hände los.“ 
Psalm 138,8 (LUT)

Der Wasserreiniger und der Bereich zum Händewaschen brauchen einen Anstrich und Wartung.

Elektrische Wartung

Die Küchenausstattung wird gewartet.

Gott stellt Literatur zur Verteilung in Chennai für 200 Missionare bereit, die in den Dörfern arbeiten.

Papa und Titus reisten in ein nahegelegenes Dorf in der Nähe von Hassan, um zu dienen und auch die örtlichen Missionare mit Kleidung zu unterstützen.

Wie Gott es ermöglicht, helfen wir weiterhin den Bedürftigen mit monatlichen Rationen für alleinstehende ältere Frauen in Not. Diese kostbaren Leben, einst verlassen, haben in seiner Gnade Trost gefunden. Wie es geschrieben steht:

„Denn ich war hungrig, und ihr habt mir zu essen gegeben; ich war durstig, und ihr habt mir zu trinken gegeben; ich war ein Fremder, und ihr habt mich aufgenommen; ich war nackt, und ihr habt mich gekleidet; ich war krank, und ihr habt mich besucht; ich war im Gefängnis, und ihr seid zu mir gekommen. Dann werden ihm die Gerechten antworten und sagen: Herr, wann sahen wir dich hungrig und speisten dich? oder durstig und gaben dir zu trinken? Wann sahen wir dich als Fremden und nahmen dich auf? oder nackt und kleideten dich? Wann sahen wir dich krank oder im Gefängnis und kamen zu dir? Und der König wird ihnen antworten und sagen: Wahrlich, ich sage euch: So wie ihr es einem dieser meiner geringsten Brüder getan habt, habt ihr es mir getan.“
Matthäus 25,35-40 (LUT)

„Ein reiner und unbefleckter Gottesdienst vor Gott und dem Vater ist der, die Waisen und Witwen in ihrer Bedrängnis zu besuchen und sich unbefleckt von der Welt zu bewahren.“ 
Jakobus 1,27 (LUT)

Vielen Dank, dass ihr uns im Gebet und in der Unterstützung beisteht, damit wir seine Liebe durch die Verkündigung des Evangeliums ehren können. Im Glauben bereiten wir uns auf die medizinische Outreach in der ersten Juliwoche vor. Weitere Updates folgen. Die Fahrzeuge benötigen etwas Wartung und Versicherung; wir lassen sie für die Reise reparieren. Wir vertrauen Gott in allem und durch alles hindurch.

„Der HERR wird alles für mich vollbringen. HERR, deine Gnade währt ewig. Lass nicht die Werke deiner Hände los.“
Psalm 138,8 (LUT)

Wir preisen Gott für die Möglichkeiten, die er gibt. Gott sei die Ehre,

Here are a few considerations and steps you might take:

1. **Character Count Management**: Implement a function that dynamically counts the total characters of your note, including all sections you're sending. This will help you understand how close you are to the limit.

2. **Conditionally Split Notes**: If your notes consistently approach or exceed the character limit, it would be prudent to implement a strategy for splitting notes. This could be done by breaking down sections or finding logical ""breakpoints"" in your content where notes can be divided without losing context or meaning.

3. **Optimize Content**: Review each section for verbosity. Sometimes, content can be efficiently condensed without losing important information.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for when notes near or exceed the limit, with clear fallback actions such as truncating non-essential sections, notifying users, or automatically splitting notes.

5. **Testing and Monitoring**: Test your implementation to ensure that notes are correctly split and formatted, and monitor the actual size of notes being sent over time to adjust your strategy as necessary.

6. **Scalability Considerations**: While planning for future growth or content expansion, keep scalability in mind. If your data or user input is likely to increase significantly, have your system scalable to adapt to that growth.

Planning ahead by implementing these strategies can prevent system rejection issues and improve the robustness of your data handling. If your notes are often around the upper limit or expected to grow, preparing your system for splitting notes is a wise decision.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":112,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1830,""usageInWh"":0.98234}","4b7afa52-257e-46a3-98cf-133de718dc27","e6c6fdc37f5247779986718dd20d086e","2025-06-24T18:36:48.0044677Z","rdhqALeKrF7CAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7CAAAAAAAAAA==/","""38013648-0000-1600-0000-685af09d0000""","attachments/","1750790301"

Schrödinger's Cat is a famous thought experiment proposed by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935 to illustrate some of the peculiar aspects of quantum mechanics.

Here's the basic idea:

Imagine a sealed box containing:
- A live cat
- A radioactive atom
- A Geiger counter (a device that detects radiation)
- A vial of poison

The setup is designed so that:
- If the radioactive atom decays (which is a random quantum event), the Geiger counter detects it.
- Detection triggers the release of poison, killing the cat.
- If the atom does not decay, the cat remains alive.

According to quantum mechanics, until we look inside the box, the atom exists in a superposition of decayed and undecayed states. Because the fate of the cat depends on the atom's state, the cat is also considered to be in a superposition: both alive and dead simultaneously.

Only when someone opens the box and observes the system does the superposition ""collapse"" into one definite state—either the cat is alive or dead.

**In summary:**
Schrödinger's Cat illustrates how quantum particles can exist in multiple states at once until measured, highlighting the strange and non-intuitive nature of quantum physics. It also raises questions about the role of observation and measurement in determining reality.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":8,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1293,""usageInWh"":0.29709}","ce4621ce-1744-437d-ab16-57959e2ac468","90d6086d99f54dbaa068194917cd7aa7","2025-06-24T19:42:49.5877329Z","rdhqALeKrF7HAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7HAAAAAAAAAA==/","""3901e9b0-0000-1600-0000-685b00490000""","attachments/","1750794313"

Es wurde von der Supply Chain Council (SCC) ins Leben gerufen und wird häufig als Referenzstandard für das Supply Chain Management verwendet. Das SCOR-Modell bietet eine gemeinsame Sprache und Struktur, um verschiedene Aspekte der Lieferkette zu analysieren, zu bewerten und zu optimieren.

### Die fünf Hauptprozesse des SCOR-Modells

1. **Plan (Planen)**:
   - Umfasst alle Aktivitäten, die notwendig sind, um die Nachfrage zu prognostizieren und die Ressourcen effizient zu planen. Dies beinhaltet Bedarfsplanung, Kapazitätsplanung und die Entwicklung von Supply-Chain-Strategien.

2. **Source (Beschaffen)**:
   - Bezieht sich auf die Auswahl und Verwaltung von Lieferanten sowie auf den Einkauf der erforderlichen Rohstoffe und Waren. Dazu gehören Aktivitäten wie Lieferantenauswahl, Bestellung und Empfang von Materialien.

3. **Make (Herstellen)**:
   - Umfasst die Produktherstellung und den Produktionsprozess. Dies beinhaltet die Umwandlung von Rohstoffen in fertige Produkte, einschließlich der Produktionsplanung und -ausführung.

4. **Deliver (Liefern)**:
   - Bezieht sich auf die Logistik und das Management der Lieferung von Produkten an den Kunden. Dazu gehören der Versand, die Auftragsabwicklung und das Management von Transport und Lagerbeständen.

5. **Return (Rückgabe)**:
   - Umfasst die Rückführung von Produkten, sei es aufgrund von Defekten oder Retouren. Dieser Prozess ist wichtig für die Kundenbindung und das Management von Reklamationen und Rücksendungen.

### Performance-Messung

Das SCOR-Modell bietet auch einen Rahmen zur Leistungsbewertung, einschließlich wichtiger Kennzahlen (KPIs) wie:
- Liefertreue
- Bestandsgenauigkeit
- Kosten der Logistik
- Produktionszykluszeiten

### Vorteile des SCOR-Modells

- **Eindeutige Terminologie**: Es schafft eine gemeinsame Sprache für alle Beteiligten in der Lieferkette.
- **Prozessstandardisierung**: Es hilft Unternehmen, ihre Prozesse zu standardisieren und Best Practices zu identifizieren.
- **Benchmarking**: Unternehmen können ihre Leistung mit anderen vergleichen, um Verbesserungspotenziale zu identifizieren.
- **Integration und Zusammenarbeit**: Fördert die Zusammenarbeit zwischen den verschiedenen Akteuren in der Lieferkette.

Eine allgemein häufig genannte Empfehlung ist:

- **Erwachsene sollten etwa 2 bis 3 Liter (oder 8 bis 12 Tassen) Flüssigkeit pro Tag zu sich nehmen.**

Hier sind einige spezifische Richtlinien:

1. **Frauen**: Etwa 2,1 Liter (ca. 9 Tassen) Flüssigkeit pro Tag.
2. **Männer**: Etwa 2,6 Liter (ca. 13 Tassen) Flüssigkeit pro Tag.
3. **Besondere Umstände**: Bei körperlicher Aktivität, heißem Wetter oder Schwangerschaft kann der Flüssigkeitsbedarf erhöht sein.

### Tipps zur ausreichenden Flüssigkeitszufuhr:

- **Wasser trinken**: Wasser ist die beste Quelle. Achte darauf, den ganzen Tag über regelmäßig zu trinken.
- **Lebensmittel**: Viele Lebensmittel, insbesondere Obst und Gemüse, haben einen hohen Wassergehalt und tragen zur Flüssigkeitsaufnahme bei.
- **Durstgefühl**: Höre auf deinen Körper. Durst ist ein natürlicher Indikator für den Flüssigkeitsbedarf.

By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take Hierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this refHierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference Hierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from tHierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the AnguHierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular vHierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular v17 doHierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular v17 documentatioHierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular v17 documentation as Hierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular v17 documentation as referenceHierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular v17 documentation as reference for Hierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular v17 documentation as reference for the follHierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular v17 documentation as reference for the following Hierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular v17 documentation as reference for the following QueHierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular v17 documentation as reference for the following Questions:Hierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular v17 documentation as reference for the following Questions:\nHierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A)."",""Take this reference from the Angular v17 documentation as reference for the following Questions:\nHierarchical injectors\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nThis topic uses the following pictographs.\n\nHTML ENTITIES\tPICTOGRAPHS\n🌺\tred hibiscus (🌺)\n🌻\tsunflower (🌻)\n🌷\ttulip (🌷)\n🌿\tfern (🌿)\n🍁\tmaple leaf (🍁)\n🐳\twhale (🐳)\n🐶\tdog (🐶)\n🦔\thedgehog (🦔)\nThe applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.\n\nThere can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.\n\nWith hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.\n\nTypes of injector hierarchies\nInjectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.\n\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:\n\nINJECTOR HIERARCHIES\tDETAILS\nEnvironmentInjector hierarchy\tConfigure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.\nElementInjector hierarchy\tCreated implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().\nNGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS\nFor NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\n\n\nEnvironmentInjector\nThe EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe ApplicationConfig providers array\nTREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()\nUsing the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.\n\nTree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.\n\nEnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.\n\nProvide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector\n})\nexport class ItemService {\n  name = 'telephone';\n}\nThe @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nModuleInjector\nIn the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:\n\nThe @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform\nThe @NgModule() providers array\nModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.\n\nChild ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.\n\nPlatform injector\nThere are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().\n\nConsider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);\nThe bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.\n\nThe platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.\n\nThe next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.\n\nThe following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.\n\nNullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector\nWhile the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.\n\nAll requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.\n\n@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG\nIf you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.\n\nHere is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.\n\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [\n  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }\n]\nFor NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.\n\nElementInjector\nAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.\n\nProviding a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  …\n  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]\n})\nexport class TestComponent\nSee the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.\n\nWhen you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.\n\nWhen the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.\n\n@Directive() and @Component()\nA component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.\n\n\nResolution rules\nWhen resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:\n\nAgainst its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.\nAgainst its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.\nWhen a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.\n\nThe requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nIf Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.\n\nIf you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.\n\nFor NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nResolution modifiers\nAngular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.\n\nFor a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.\n\nTypes of modifiers\nResolution modifiers fall into three categories:\n\nWhat to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()\nWhere to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()\nWhere to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()\nBy default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.\n\nAdditionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:\n\n@Host() and @Self()\n@SkipSelf() and @Self().\n\n@Optional()\n@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.\n\nsrc/app/optional/optional.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class OptionalComponent {\n  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}\n}\n@Self()\nUse @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.\n\nA good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().\n\nFor example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.\n\nsrc/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self-no-data',\n  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']\n})\nexport class SelfNoDataComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.\n\nAnother example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.\n\nsrc/app/self/self.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-self',\n  templateUrl: './self.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]\n})\nexport class SelfComponent {\n  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\n@SkipSelf()\n@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.\n\nTo see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:\n\nsrc/app/leaf.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class LeafService {\n  emoji = '🌿';\n}\nImagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():\n\nsrc/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-skipself',\n  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],\n  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance\n  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]\n})\nexport class SkipselfComponent {\n  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }\n}\nIn this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.\n\n@SkipSelf() with @Optional()\nUse @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.\n\ncontent_copy\nclass Person {\n  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}\n}\n@Host()\n@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:\n\nsrc/app/host/host.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-host',\n  templateUrl: './host.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],\n  //  provide the service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],\n  imports: [HostChildComponent]\n})\nexport class HostComponent {\n  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service\n  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }\n\n}\nSince HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.\n\nLogical structure of the template\nWhen you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.\n\nComponents are used in your templates, as in the following example:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <app-child></app-child>\n</app-root>\nUsually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.\n\nThe following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n     <#VIEW>\n       …content goes here…\n     </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nUnderstanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.\n\nProviding services in @Component()\nHow you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().\n\nA component class can provide services in two ways:\n\nARRAYS\tDETAILS\nWith a providers array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n  providers: [ \n    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} \n  ] \n})\nWith a viewProviders array\t\ncontent_copy\n@Component({ \n  … \n viewProviders: [ \n    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} \n  ] \n})\nTo understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.\n\nIn the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.\n\nANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE\tDETAILS\n@Inject(Token)=>Value\nDemonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.\n@Provide(Token=Value)\nDemonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.\nApplicationConfig(Token)\nDemonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.\nExample app structure\nThe example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.\n\nsrc/app/flower.service.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class FlowerService {\n  emoji = '🌺';\n}\nConsider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n    </app-child>\n</app-root>\nHowever, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->\n    <#VIEW>\n        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->\n            <#VIEW>\n            </#VIEW>\n        </app-child>\n    </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.\n\nKnowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.\n\nNow, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}\n}\nAdd a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nThe output in the view would be:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:\n\nThe injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.\n\nIf the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.\n\nIn the example case, the constraints are:\n\nStart with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.\n\nNormally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.\n\nThe ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.\n\nThe ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.\n\nUsing the providers array\nNow, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // use the providers array to provide a service\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject the service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }\n}\nNow that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.\n\nThe next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\nTo render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nIn the logical tree, this is represented as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")\n               @Inject(FlowerService)=>\""🌻\""> <!-- search ends here -->\n      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->\n        <h2>Child Component</h2>\n        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWhen <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.\n\n\nUsing the viewProviders array\nUse the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.\n\nThe steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.\n\nThe example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.\n\nFirst, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:\n\nsrc/app/animal.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class AnimalService {\n  emoji = '🐳';\n}\nFollowing the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class AppComponent  {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}\n}\nYou can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.\n\nAdd a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.\n\nsrc/app/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  templateUrl: './child.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],\n  // provide services\n  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\n\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  // inject service\n  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nAdd bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:\n\nsrc/app/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nAdditionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nNow you should see both values in the browser:\n\nAppComponent\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nChild Component\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThe logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nJust as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.\n\nproviders vs. viewProviders\nTo see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nexport class InspectorComponent {\n  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }\n}\nYou do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:\n\nsrc/app/inspector/inspector.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\nRemember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.ts\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  ...\n  imports: [InspectorComponent]\n})\nNext, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:\n\nsrc/app/child/child.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>\n<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>\n\n<div class=\""container\"">\n  <h3>Content projection</h3>\n\t<ng-content></ng-content>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Inside the view</h3>\n<app-inspector></app-inspector>\nThe first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.\n\nNext, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.\n\nsrc/app/app.component.html\ncontent_copy\n<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>\nThe browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:\n\n//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.\n\nContent projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see\npuppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐳\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌻\nEmoji from AnimalService: 🐶\nThese four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.\n\nThe next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.\n\nThe AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n            @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐶\"")>\n        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->\n        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n  \n        <div class=\""container\"">\n          <h3>Content projection</h3>\n          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐳\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>\n          </app-inspector>\n        </div>\n\n        <app-inspector>\n          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>\""🐶\"">\n            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>\n          </#VIEW>\n        </app-inspector>\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThe projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nModifying service visibility\nThis section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().\n\nVisibility of provided tokens\nVisibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.\n\nTo alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:\n\ncontent_copy\nconstructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }\nWith @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:\n\nEmoji from FlowerService: 🌺\nIn a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")>\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>\""🌺\"">\n        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nThough <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.\n\nIf you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>\""🌺\"">\n  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->\n    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=\""🌻\"")> <!-- start search here -->\n      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-parent>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nHere, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.\n\nThe example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.\n\n@SkipSelf() and viewProviders\nThe <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.\n\nAs in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  // add @SkipSelf()\n  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nInstead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n})\nThe logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>\""🐳\"")>\n        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nWith @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.\n\n@Host() and viewProviders\nIf you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-child',\n  …\n  viewProviders:\n  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]\n  ...\n\n})\nexport class ChildComponent {\n  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n}\n@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n          @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW>\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>\""🐶\"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->\n      </#VIEW>\n    </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\nAdd a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:\n\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],\n  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]\n  ...\n})\nNext, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:\n\ncontent_copy\nexport class ChildComponent {\n\n  constructor(\n  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }\n\n}\nWhen @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.\n\nHowever, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.\n\nThe logical tree representation shows why this is:\n\ncontent_copy\n<app-root ApplicationConfig\n        @Inject(AnimalService=>\""🐳\"")>\n  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🦔\"")\n         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->\n    <app-child>\n      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=\""🐶\"")\n             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>\""🦔\"">\n               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->\n      </#VIEW>\n      </app-child>\n  </#VIEW>\n</app-root>\n@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.\n\n\nElementInjector use case examples\nThe ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.\n\nScenario: service isolation\nArchitectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.\n\nIf you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.\n\nInstead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:\n\nsrc/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)\ncontent_copy\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-villains-list',\n  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',\n  providers: [ VillainsService ],\n  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]\n})\nBy providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.\n\nVillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.\n\nScenario: multiple edit sessions\nMany applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.\n\nTo demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.\n\nTo open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.\n\nEach tax return component has the following characteristics:\n\nIs its own tax return editing session\nCan change a tax return without affecting a return in another component\nHas the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them\nHeroes in action\nSuppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.\n\nThe HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class HeroTaxReturnService {\n  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }\n\n  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {\n    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;\n    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();\n  }\n\n  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {\n    return this.currentTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  restoreTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;\n  }\n\n  saveTaxReturn() {\n    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;\n    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();\n  }\n}\nHere is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts\ncontent_copy\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';\nimport { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',\n  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],\n  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.\n\nThis won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.\n\nTo prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.\n\nsrc/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)\ncontent_copy\nproviders: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],\nThe HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.\n\nThe rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.\n\nScenario: specialized providers\nAnother reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.\n\nFor example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.\n\nThe root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.\n\nCar component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.\n\nChild component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).\n\nChild component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.\n\ncar components\nBehind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.\n\nWhen you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:\n\nAn instance of Car resolved by injector (C)\nAn Engine resolved by injector (B)\nIts Tires resolved by the root injector (A).""]","Take this reference from the Angular v17 documentation as reference for the following Questions:
Hierarchical injectors
Injectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.

The applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.

There can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.

With hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.

Types of injector hierarchies
Injectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.

Angular has two injector hierarchies:

INJECTOR HIERARCHIES	DETAILS
EnvironmentInjector hierarchy	Configure an ElementInjector in this hierarchy using @Injectable() or providers array in ApplicationConfig.
ElementInjector hierarchy	Created implicitly at each DOM element. An ElementInjector is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().
NGMODULE BASED APPLICATIONS
For NgModule based applications, you can provide dependencies with the ModuleInjector hierarchy using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.


EnvironmentInjector
The EnvironmentInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:

The @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform
The ApplicationConfig providers array
TREE-SHAKING AND @INJECTABLE()
Using the @Injectable() providedIn property is preferable to using the ApplicationConfig providers array. With @Injectable() providedIn, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.

Tree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about tree-shakable providers in Introduction to services and dependency injection.

EnvironmentInjector is configured by the ApplicationConfig.providers.

Provide services with the providedIn property of @Injectable() as follows:

content_copy
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ElementInjector
})
export class ItemService {
  name = 'telephone';
}
The @Injectable() decorator identifies a service class. The providedIn property configures a specific EnvironmentInjector, here root, which makes the service available in the root EnvironmentInjector.

ModuleInjector
In the case of NgModule based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:

The @Injectable() providedIn property to refer to root or platform
The @NgModule() providers array
ModuleInjector is configured by the @NgModule.providers and NgModule.imports property. ModuleInjector is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the NgModule.imports recursively.

Child ModuleInjector hierarchies are created when lazy loading other @NgModules.

Platform injector
There are two more injectors above root, an additional EnvironmentInjector and NullInjector().

Consider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in main.ts:

content_copy
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);
The bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the ApplicationConfig instance. This is the root EnvironmentInjector.

The platformBrowserDynamic() method creates an injector configured by a PlatformModule, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying extraProviders using the platformBrowser() function.

The next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector(), which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the NullInjector(), you'll get an error unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null. For more information on @Optional(), see the @Optional() section of this guide.

The following diagram represents the relationship between the root ModuleInjector and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.

NullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector
While the name root is a special alias, other EnvironmentInjector hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create EnvironmentInjector hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child EnvironmentInjector hierarchies.

All requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the ApplicationConfig instance passed to the bootstrapApplication() method, or registered all providers with root in their own services.

@INJECTABLE() VS. APPLICATIONCONFIG
If you configure an app-wide provider in the ApplicationConfig of bootstrapApplication, it overrides one configured for root in the @Injectable() metadata. You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.

Here is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default location strategy by listing its provider in the providers list of the ApplicationConfig.

content_copy
providers: [
  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }
]
For NgModule based applications, configure app-wide providers in the AppModule.

ElementInjector
Angular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.

Providing a service in the @Component() decorator using its providers or viewProviders property configures an ElementInjector. For example, the following TestComponent configures the ElementInjector by providing the service as follows:

content_copy
@Component({
  …
  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]
})
export class TestComponent
See the resolution rules section to understand the relationship between the EnvironmentInjector tree, the ModuleInjector tree, and the ElementInjector tree.

When you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the ElementInjector at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the resolution rules section.

When the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.

@Directive() and @Component()
A component is a special type of directive, which means that just as @Directive() has a providers property, @Component() does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the providers property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the providers property, that provider belongs to the ElementInjector of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.


Resolution rules
When resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:

Against its parents in the ElementInjector hierarchy.
Against its parents in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy.
When a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own ElementInjector. If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's ElementInjector.

The requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor ElementInjector hierarchies.

If Angular doesn't find the provider in any ElementInjector hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the EnvironmentInjector hierarchy. If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.

If you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency. If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service, Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.

For NgModule based applications, Angular will search the ModuleInjector hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the ElementInjector hierarchies.

Resolution modifiers
Angular's resolution behavior can be modified with @Optional(), @Self(), @SkipSelf() and @Host(). Import each of them from @angular/core and use each in the component class constructor or in the inject configuration when you inject your service.

For a working application showcasing the resolution modifiers that this section covers, see the resolution modifiers example / download example.

Types of modifiers
Resolution modifiers fall into three categories:

What to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is @Optional()
Where to start looking, that is @SkipSelf()
Where to stop looking, @Host() and @Self()
By default, Angular always starts at the current Injector and keeps searching all the way up. Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or self, location and the ending location.

Additionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:

@Host() and @Self()
@SkipSelf() and @Self().

@Optional()
@Optional() allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional. This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as null, rather than throwing an error. In the following example, the service, OptionalService, isn't provided in the service, ApplicationConfig, @NgModule(), or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.

src/app/optional/optional.component.ts
content_copy
export class OptionalComponent {
  constructor(@Optional() public optional?: OptionalService) {}
}
@Self()
Use @Self() so that Angular will only look at the ElementInjector for the current component or directive.

A good use case for @Self() is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element. To avoid errors in this situation, combine @Self() with @Optional().

For example, in the following SelfComponent, notice the injected LeafService in the constructor.

src/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts
content_copy
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-self-no-data',
  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']
})
export class SelfNoDataComponent {
  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }
}
In this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with @Self() and @Optional() will return null because @Self() tells the injector to only search in the current host element.

Another example shows the component class with a provider for FlowerService. In this case, the injector looks no further than the current ElementInjector because it finds the FlowerService and returns the tulip 🌷.

src/app/self/self.component.ts
content_copy
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-self',
  templateUrl: './self.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./self.component.css'],
  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]
})
export class SelfComponent {
  constructor(@Self() public flower: FlowerService) {}
}
@SkipSelf()
@SkipSelf() is the opposite of @Self(). With @SkipSelf(), Angular starts its search for a service in the parent ElementInjector, rather than in the current one. So if the parent ElementInjector were using the fern 🌿 value for emoji, but you had maple leaf 🍁 in the component's providers array, Angular would ignore maple leaf 🍁 and use fern 🌿.

To see this in code, assume that the following value for emoji is what the parent component were using, as in this service:

src/app/leaf.service.ts
content_copy
export class LeafService {
  emoji = '🌿';
}
Imagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf 🍁 but you wanted to use the parent's value instead. This is when you'd use @SkipSelf():

src/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts
content_copy
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-skipself',
  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],
  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance
  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]
})
export class SkipselfComponent {
  // Use @SkipSelf() in the constructor
  constructor(@SkipSelf() public leaf: LeafService) { }
}
In this case, the value you'd get for emoji would be fern 🌿, not maple leaf 🍁.

@SkipSelf() with @Optional()
Use @SkipSelf() with @Optional() to prevent an error if the value is null. In the following example, the Person service is injected in the constructor. @SkipSelf() tells Angular to skip the current injector and @Optional() will prevent an error should the Person service be null.

content_copy
class Person {
  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parent?: Person) {}
}
@Host()
@Host() lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers. Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking. Use @Host() as follows:

src/app/host/host.component.ts
content_copy
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-host',
  templateUrl: './host.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],
  //  provide the service
  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }],
  imports: [HostChildComponent]
})
export class HostComponent {
  // use @Host() in the constructor when injecting the service
  constructor(@Host() @Optional() public flower?: FlowerService) { }

}
Since HostComponent has @Host() in its constructor, no matter what the parent of HostComponent might have as a flower.emoji value, the HostComponent will use tulip 🌷.

Logical structure of the template
When you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the ElementInjector tree relative to where and how you provide those services.

Understanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.

Components are used in your templates, as in the following example:

content_copy
<app-root>
  <app-child></app-child>
</app-root>
Usually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files. For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree. The term logical distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree. To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the <#VIEW> pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.

The following is an example of how the <app-root> and <app-child> view trees are combined into a single logical tree:

content_copy
<app-root>
  <#VIEW>
    <app-child>
     <#VIEW>
       …content goes here…
     </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>
Understanding the idea of the <#VIEW> demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.

Providing services in @Component()
How you provide services using a @Component() (or @Directive()) decorator determines their visibility. The following sections demonstrate providers and viewProviders along with ways to modify service visibility with @SkipSelf() and @Host().

A component class can provide services in two ways:

ARRAYS	DETAILS
With a providers array	
content_copy
@Component({ 
  … 
  providers: [ 
    {provide: FlowerService, useValue: {emoji: '🌺'}} 
  ] 
})
With a viewProviders array	
content_copy
@Component({ 
  … 
 viewProviders: [ 
    {provide: AnimalService, useValue: {emoji: '🐶'}} 
  ] 
})
To understand how the providers and viewProviders influence service visibility differently, the following sections build a live example / download example step-by-step and compare the use of providers and viewProviders in code and a logical tree.

In the logical tree, you'll find @Provide, @Inject, and ApplicationConfig, which are not real HTML attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.

ANGULAR SERVICE ATTRIBUTE	DETAILS
@Inject(Token)=>Value
Demonstrates that if Token is injected at this location in the logical tree its value would be Value.
@Provide(Token=Value)
Demonstrates that there is a declaration of Token provider with value Value at this location in the logical tree.
ApplicationConfig(Token)
Demonstrates that a fallback EnvironmentInjector should be used at this location.
Example app structure
The example application has a FlowerService provided in root with an emoji value of red hibiscus 🌺.

src/app/flower.service.ts
content_copy
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class FlowerService {
  emoji = '🌺';
}
Consider an application with only an AppComponent and a ChildComponent. The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:

content_copy
<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->
    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->
    </app-child>
</app-root>
However, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:

content_copy
<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->
    <#VIEW>
        <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->
            <#VIEW>
            </#VIEW>
        </app-child>
    </#VIEW>
</app-root>
The <#VIEW> here represents an instance of a template. Notice that each component has its own <#VIEW>.

Knowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.

Now, consider that <app-root> injects the FlowerService:

src/app/app.component.ts
content_copy
export class AppComponent  {
  constructor(public flower: FlowerService) {}
}
Add a binding to the <app-root> template to visualize the result:

src/app/app.component.html
content_copy
<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>
The output in the view would be:

Emoji from FlowerService: 🌺
In the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:

content_copy
<app-root ApplicationConfig
        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>""🌺"">
  <#VIEW>
    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>
    <app-child>
      <#VIEW>
      </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>
When <app-root> requests the FlowerService, it is the injector's job to resolve the FlowerService token. The resolution of the token happens in two phases:

The injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search. The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each level in the logical tree. If the token is found it is returned.

If the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent EnvironmentInjector to delegate the request to.

In the example case, the constraints are:

Start with <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root> and end with <app-root>.

Normally the starting point for search is at the point of injection. However, in this case <app-root> @Components are special in that they also include their own viewProviders, which is why the search starts at <#VIEW> belonging to <app-root>. This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.

The ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.

The ElementInjector provided by the ApplicationConfig acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the ElementInjector hierarchies.

Using the providers array
Now, in the ChildComponent class, add a provider for FlowerService to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:

src/app/child.component.ts
content_copy
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-child',
  templateUrl: './child.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],
  // use the providers array to provide a service
  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]
})

export class ChildComponent {
  // inject the service
  constructor( public flower: FlowerService) { }
}
Now that the FlowerService is provided in the @Component() decorator, when the <app-child> requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the ElementInjector in the <app-child>. It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.

The next step is to add a binding to the ChildComponent template.

src/app/child.component.html
content_copy
<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>
To render the new values, add <app-child> to the bottom of the AppComponent template so the view also displays the sunflower:

Child Component
Emoji from FlowerService: 🌻
In the logical tree, this is represented as follows:

content_copy
<app-root ApplicationConfig
        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>""🌺"">
  <#VIEW>
    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌺)</p>
    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=""🌻"")
               @Inject(FlowerService)=>""🌻""> <!-- search ends here -->
      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->
        <h2>Child Component</h2>
        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (🌻)</p>
      </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>
When <app-child> requests the FlowerService, the injector begins its search at the <#VIEW> belonging to <app-child> (<#VIEW> is included because it is injected from @Component()) and ends with <app-child>. In this case, the FlowerService is resolved in the providers array with sunflower 🌻 of the <app-child>. The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree. It stops as soon as it finds the FlowerService and never sees the red hibiscus 🌺.


Using the viewProviders array
Use the viewProviders array as another way to provide services in the @Component() decorator. Using viewProviders makes services visible in the <#VIEW>.

The steps are the same as using the providers array, with the exception of using the viewProviders array instead.

For step-by-step instructions, continue with this section. If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to Modifying service availability.

The example application features a second service, the AnimalService to demonstrate viewProviders.

First, create an AnimalService with an emoji property of whale 🐳:

src/app/animal.service.ts
content_copy
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AnimalService {
  emoji = '🐳';
}
Following the same pattern as with the FlowerService, inject the AnimalService in the AppComponent class:

src/app/app.component.ts
content_copy
export class AppComponent  {
  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) {}
}
You can leave all the FlowerService related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the AnimalService.

Add a viewProviders array and inject the AnimalService in the <app-child> class, too, but give emoji a different value. Here, it has a value of dog 🐶.

src/app/child.component.ts
content_copy
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-child',
  templateUrl: './child.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],
  // provide services
  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],
  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }],
  imports: [InspectorComponent]
})

export class ChildComponent {
  // inject service
  constructor( public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }
}
Add bindings to the ChildComponent and the AppComponent templates. In the ChildComponent template, add the following binding:

src/app/child.component.html
content_copy
<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>
Additionally, add the same to the AppComponent template:

src/app/app.component.html
content_copy
<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>
Now you should see both values in the browser:

AppComponent
Emoji from AnimalService: 🐳

Child Component
Emoji from AnimalService: 🐶
The logic tree for this example of viewProviders is as follows:

content_copy
<app-root ApplicationConfig
         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>""🐳"">
  <#VIEW>
    <app-child>
      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=""🐶"")
            @Inject(AnimalService=>""🐶"")>
       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->
       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>
      </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>
Just as with the FlowerService example, the AnimalService is provided in the <app-child> @Component() decorator. This means that since the injector first looks in the ElementInjector of the component, it finds the AnimalService value of dog 🐶. It doesn't need to continue searching the ElementInjector tree, nor does it need to search the ModuleInjector.

providers vs. viewProviders
To see the difference between using providers and viewProviders, add another component to the example and call it InspectorComponent. InspectorComponent will be a child of the ChildComponent. In inspector.component.ts, inject the FlowerService and AnimalService in the constructor:

src/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts
content_copy
export class InspectorComponent {
  constructor(public flower: FlowerService, public animal: AnimalService) { }
}
You do not need a providers or viewProviders array. Next, in inspector.component.html, add the same markup from previous components:

src/app/inspector/inspector.component.html
content_copy
<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>
<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>
Remember to add the InspectorComponent to the ChildComponent imports array.

src/app/child/child.component.ts
content_copy
@Component({
  ...
  imports: [InspectorComponent]
})
Next, make sure your child.component.html contains the following:

src/app/child/child.component.html
content_copy
<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>
<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>

<div class=""container"">
  <h3>Content projection</h3>
	<ng-content></ng-content>
</div>

<h3>Inside the view</h3>
<app-inspector></app-inspector>
The first two lines, with the bindings, are there from previous steps. The new parts are <ng-content> and <app-inspector>. <ng-content> allows you to project content, and <app-inspector> inside the ChildComponent template makes the InspectorComponent a child component of ChildComponent.

Next, add the following to app.component.html to take advantage of content projection.

src/app/app.component.html
content_copy
<app-child><app-inspector></app-inspector></app-child>
The browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:

//…Omitting previous examples. The following applies to this section.

Content projection: this is coming from content. Doesn't get to see
puppy because the puppy is declared inside the view only.

Emoji from FlowerService: 🌻
Emoji from AnimalService: 🐳

Emoji from FlowerService: 🌻
Emoji from AnimalService: 🐶
These four bindings demonstrate the difference between providers and viewProviders. Since the dog 🐶 is declared inside the <#VIEW>, it isn't visible to the projected content. Instead, the projected content sees the whale 🐳.

The next section though, where InspectorComponent is a child component of ChildComponent, InspectorComponent is inside the <#VIEW>, so when it asks for the AnimalService, it sees the dog 🐶.

The AnimalService in the logical tree would look like this:

content_copy
<app-root ApplicationConfig
         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>""🐳"">
  <#VIEW>
    <app-child>
      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=""🐶"")
            @Inject(AnimalService=>""🐶"")>
        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->
        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>
  
        <div class=""container"">
          <h3>Content projection</h3>
          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>""🐳"">
            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐳)</p>
          </app-inspector>
        </div>

        <app-inspector>
          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>""🐶"">
            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (🐶)</p>
          </#VIEW>
        </app-inspector>
      </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>
The projected content of <app-inspector> sees the whale 🐳, not the dog 🐶, because the dog 🐶 is inside the <app-child> <#VIEW>. The <app-inspector> can only see the dog 🐶 if it is also within the <#VIEW>.


Modifying service visibility
This section describes how to limit the scope of the beginning and ending ElementInjector using the visibility decorators @Host(), @Self(), and @SkipSelf().

Visibility of provided tokens
Visibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree. To do this, place visibility decorators at the point of injection, that is, the constructor(), rather than at a point of declaration.

To alter where the injector starts looking for FlowerService, add @SkipSelf() to the <app-child> @Inject declaration for the FlowerService. This declaration is in the <app-child> constructor as shown in child.component.ts:

content_copy
constructor(@SkipSelf() public flower : FlowerService) { }
With @SkipSelf(), the <app-child> injector doesn't look to itself for the FlowerService. Instead, the injector starts looking for the FlowerService at the ElementInjector or the <app-root>, where it finds nothing. Then, it goes back to the <app-child> ModuleInjector and finds the red hibiscus 🌺 value, which is available because the <app-child> ModuleInjector and the <app-root> ModuleInjector are flattened into one ModuleInjector. Thus, the UI renders the following:

Emoji from FlowerService: 🌺
In a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:

content_copy
<app-root ApplicationConfig
        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>""🌺"">
  <#VIEW>
    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=""🌻"")>
      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>""🌺"">
        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree -->
      </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>
Though <app-child> provides the sunflower 🌻, the application renders the red hibiscus 🌺 because @SkipSelf() causes the current injector to skip itself and look to its parent.

If you now add @Host() (in addition to the @SkipSelf()) to the @Inject of the FlowerService, the result will be null. This is because @Host() limits the upper bound of the search to the <#VIEW>. Here's the idea in the logical tree:

content_copy
<app-root ApplicationConfig
        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>""🌺"">
  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->
    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService=""🌻"")> <!-- start search here -->
      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>null>
      </#VIEW>
      </app-parent>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>
Here, the services and their values are the same, but @Host() stops the injector from looking any further than the <#VIEW> for FlowerService, so it doesn't find it and returns null.

The example application uses @Optional() so the application does not throw an error, but the principles are the same.

@SkipSelf() and viewProviders
The <app-child> currently provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with the value of dog 🐶. Because the injector has only to look at the ElementInjector of the <app-child> for the AnimalService, it never sees the whale 🐳.

As in the FlowerService example, if you add @SkipSelf() to the constructor for the AnimalService, the injector won't look in the ElementInjector of the current <app-child> for the AnimalService.

content_copy
export class ChildComponent {

  // add @SkipSelf()
  constructor(@SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }

}
Instead, the injector will begin at the <app-root> ElementInjector. Remember that the <app-child> class provides the AnimalService in the viewProviders array with a value of dog 🐶:

content_copy
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-child',
  …
  viewProviders:
  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]
  ...
})
The logical tree looks like this with @SkipSelf() in <app-child>:

content_copy
<app-root ApplicationConfig
          @Inject(AnimalService=>""🐳"")>
  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->
    <app-child>
      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=""🐶"")
             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>""🐳"")>
        <!--Add @SkipSelf -->
      </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>
With @SkipSelf() in the <app-child>, the injector begins its search for the AnimalService in the <app-root> ElementInjector and finds whale 🐳.

@Host() and viewProviders
If you add @Host() to the constructor for AnimalService, the result is dog 🐶 because the injector finds the AnimalService in the <app-child> <#VIEW>. Here is the viewProviders array in the <app-child> class and @Host() in the constructor:

content_copy
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-child',
  …
  viewProviders:
  [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]
  ...

})
export class ChildComponent {
  constructor(@Host() public animal : AnimalService) { }
}
@Host() causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the <#VIEW>.

content_copy
<app-root ApplicationConfig
          @Inject(AnimalService=>""🐳"")>
  <#VIEW>
    <app-child>
      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=""🐶"")
             @Inject(AnimalService, @Host=>""🐶"")> <!-- @Host stops search here -->
      </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>
Add a viewProviders array with a third animal, hedgehog 🦔, to the app.component.ts @Component() metadata:

content_copy
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],
  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🦔' } }]
  ...
})
Next, add @SkipSelf() along with @Host() to the constructor for the Animal Service in child.component.ts. Here are @Host() and @SkipSelf() in the <app-child> constructor:

content_copy
export class ChildComponent {

  constructor(
  @Host() @SkipSelf() public animal : AnimalService) { }

}
When @Host() and @SkipSelf() were applied to the FlowerService, which is in the providers array, the result was null because @SkipSelf() starts its search in the <app-child> injector, but @Host() stops searching at <#VIEW> —where there is no FlowerService In the logical tree, you can see that the FlowerService is visible in <app-child>, not its <#VIEW>.

However, the AnimalService, which is provided in the AppComponent viewProviders array, is visible.

The logical tree representation shows why this is:

content_copy
<app-root ApplicationConfig
        @Inject(AnimalService=>""🐳"")>
  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=""🦔"")
         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>""🦔"">
    <!-- ^^@SkipSelf() starts here,  @Host() stops here^^ -->
    <app-child>
      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService=""🐶"")
             @Inject(AnimalService, @SkipSelf, @Host, @Optional)=>""🦔"">
               <!-- Add @SkipSelf ^^-->
      </#VIEW>
      </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>
@SkipSelf(), causes the injector to start its search for the AnimalService at the <app-root>, not the <app-child>, where the request originates, and @Host() stops the search at the <app-root> <#VIEW>. Since AnimalService is provided by way of the viewProviders array, the injector finds hedgehog 🦔 in the <#VIEW>.


ElementInjector use case examples
The ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities. For a look at the following scenarios in a working app, see the heroes use case examples / download example.

Scenario: service isolation
Architectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs. For example, the guide sample includes a VillainsListComponent that displays a list of villains. It gets those villains from a VillainsService.

If you provided VillainsService in the root AppModule (where you registered the HeroesService), that would make the VillainsService visible everywhere in the application, including the Hero workflows. If you later modified the VillainsService, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.

Instead, you can provide the VillainsService in the providers metadata of the VillainsListComponent like this:

src/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)
content_copy
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-villains-list',
  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',
  providers: [ VillainsService ],
  imports: [ NgFor, AsyncPipe ]
})
By providing VillainsService in the VillainsListComponent metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the VillainsListComponent and its subcomponent tree.

VillainService is a singleton with respect to VillainsListComponent because that is where it is declared. As long as VillainsListComponent does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of VillainService but if there are multiple instances of VillainsListComponent, then each instance of VillainsListComponent will have its own instance of VillainService.

Scenario: multiple edit sessions
Many applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time. For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.

To demonstrate that scenario, imagine an outer HeroListComponent that displays a list of super heroes.

To open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return. Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.

Each tax return component has the following characteristics:

Is its own tax return editing session
Can change a tax return without affecting a return in another component
Has the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them
Heroes in action
Suppose that the HeroTaxReturnComponent had logic to manage and restore changes. That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return. In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky. You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.

The HeroTaxReturnService caches a single HeroTaxReturn, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it. It also delegates to the application-wide singleton HeroService, which it gets by injection.

src/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts
content_copy
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';
import { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';

@Injectable()
export class HeroTaxReturnService {
  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;
  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;

  constructor(private heroService: HeroesService) { }

  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {
    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;
    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();
  }

  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {
    return this.currentTaxReturn;
  }

  restoreTaxReturn() {
    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;
  }

  saveTaxReturn() {
    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;
    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();
  }
}
Here is the HeroTaxReturnComponent that makes use of HeroTaxReturnService.

src/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts
content_copy
import { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';
import { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';
import { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',
  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',
  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],
  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],
The tax-return-to-edit arrives by way of the @Input() property, which is implemented with getters and setters. The setter initializes the component's own instance of the HeroTaxReturnService with the incoming return. The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero. The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.

This won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton. Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.

To prevent this, configure the component-level injector of HeroTaxReturnComponent to provide the service, using the providers property in the component metadata.

src/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)
content_copy
providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ],
The HeroTaxReturnComponent has its own provider of the HeroTaxReturnService. Recall that every component instance has its own injector. Providing the service at the component level ensures that every instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.

The rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation. You can review it and download it from the live example / download example.

Scenario: specialized providers
Another reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a more specialized implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.

For example, consider a Car component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.

The root injector, marked as (A), uses generic providers for details about CarService and EngineService.

Car component (A). Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.

Child component (B). Component (B) defines its own, specialized providers for CarService and EngineService that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).

Child component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even more specialized provider for CarService.

car components
Behind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.

When you resolve an instance of Car at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:

An instance of Car resolved by injector (C)
An Engine resolved by injector (B)
Its Tires resolved by the root injector (A).","0","gpt-4.1-nano","2","true","2025-06-25T05:51:03.379844Z","Great!

Below are the steps and code snippets that will guide you through the process.

### Step 1: Create a Standalone Component

First, you need to create a standalone component that will accept inputs. Here is an example component named `DynamicComponent` that takes a title and a description.

```typescript
// dynamic.component.ts
import { Component, Input, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-dynamic',
  template: `
    <h3>{{ title }}</h3>
    <p>{{ description }}</p>
  `
})
export class DynamicComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() title!: string;
  @Input() description!: string;

  ngOnInit() {
    console.log('DynamicComponent initialized with title:', this.title);
    console.log('DynamicComponent initialized with description:', this.description);
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Host Component

Next, create a component that will host the dynamic component. This component will use `ViewContainerRef` to create the dynamic component at runtime.

```typescript
// host.component.ts
import { Component, ComponentFactoryResolver, OnInit, ViewChild, ViewContainerRef } from '@angular/core';
import { DynamicComponent } from './dynamic.component';

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-host',
  template: `
    <ng-container #dynamicContainer></ng-container>
    <button (click)=""addDynamicComponent()"">Add Dynamic Component</button>
  `
})
export class HostComponent implements OnInit {
  @ViewChild('dynamicContainer', { read: ViewContainerRef }) dynamicContainer!: ViewContainerRef;

  constructor(private componentFactoryResolver: ComponentFactoryResolver) {}

  ngOnInit() {}

  addDynamicComponent() {
    const componentFactory = this.componentFactoryResolver.resolveComponentFactory(DynamicComponent);
    const dynamicComponentRef = this.dynamicContainer.createComponent(componentFactory);

    // Set inputs for the dynamic component
    dynamicComponentRef.instance.title = 'Dynamic Title';
    dynamicComponentRef.instance.description = 'This is a dynamically generated component!';

    // You can also subscribe to input changes here if needed
    dynamicComponentRef.instance.ngOnInit(); // Manually call ngOnInit to access the inputs
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Update the Angular Module

In the `AppModule`, make sure to declare both components and set `DynamicComponent` as a standalone component in the imports.

```typescript
// app.module.ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { HostComponent } from './host.component';
import { DynamicComponent } from './dynamic.component';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    DynamicComponent // Import the standalone component here
  ],
  declarations: [HostComponent],
  bootstrap: [HostComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

Now you can run your Angular application (typically via `ng serve`) and click the button to create instances of the `DynamicComponent`. You'll see the title and description logged to the console when created.

### Summary

In this example:
- We created a standalone dynamic component (`DynamicComponent`) that takes `title` and `description` as inputs.
- A host component (`HostComponent`) is responsible for rendering the `DynamicComponent` dynamically upon button click.
- We used `ViewContainerRef` to create the dynamic instance and set the inputs before initializing.

With Angular v17's features, you can leverage this approach to dynamically create components while maintaining clean and manageable code.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":9650,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3813,""usageInWh"":2.1389}","799d1ccb-e663-49f1-82fc-bfd89a67bf50","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-25T05:51:12.3000848Z","rdhqALeKrF7MAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7MAAAAAAAAAA==/","""4401955f-0000-1600-0000-685b8e9d0000""","attachments/","1750830749"

Here's a complete example using the `ViewContainerRef` to dynamically create a component, leveraging the provided injector and environment injector:

### Step 1: Adjust the Code to Dynamically Create `WorkItemComponent`

We'll assume that `WorkItemComponent` is defined to accept some inputs from the provided `workItemInfo`. Below is how you can modify the code accordingly:

```typescript
import { ViewContainerRef, createEnvironmentInjector, inject } from '@angular/core';
import { WorkItemComponent } from 'src/app/modules/work-item/work-item.component'; // Make sure to import properly

// Assuming this code snippet is part of a function or method within a component or service
const viewContainerRef = inject(ViewContainerRef);

// Create an environment injector to pass data into the WorkItemComponent
const envInjector = createEnvironmentInjector(
    [
        {
            provide: 'workItemInfo', // Token for dependency injection
            useValue: this.outletInfo // The data you want to pass in
        },
    ],
    this.injector // The parent injector context
);

// Clear the ViewContainerRef to ensure no previous instances exist
viewContainerRef.clear();

// Dynamically create the WorkItemComponent
viewContainerRef.createComponent(WorkItemComponent, {
    environmentInjector: envInjector // Pass the environment injector
});
```

### Step 2: Ensure WorkItemComponent Receives the Input Correctly

In your `WorkItemComponent`, you should ensure that you are set up to receive the injected value through `@Inject`.

**Example WorkItemComponent:**

```typescript
import { Component, Inject, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-work-item',
  template: `
    <div>Work Item Info: {{ workItemInfo | json }}</div>
  `
})
export class WorkItemComponent implements OnInit {
  workItemInfo: any;

  constructor(@Inject('workItemInfo') private info: any) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.workItemInfo = this.info; // Set the injected value
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Ensure Module Imports

In your `WorkItemModule`, ensure that the `WorkItemComponent` is declared and exported properly.

**Example WorkItemModule:**

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { WorkItemComponent } from './work-item.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [WorkItemComponent],
  imports: [CommonModule],
  exports: [WorkItemComponent] // Export the component if needed elsewhere
})
export class WorkItemModule {}
```

### Summary

- The environment injector allows you to pass in tokens defined at the point of creation for dependency injection.
- The `WorkItemComponent` must utilize the `@Inject` decorator to access the data provided via the newly created environment injector.
- Make sure to import `WorkItemComponent` correctly from its module to ensure that Angular can find and use it.
- Clear the `ViewContainerRef` before creating a new instance to prevent any conflicts with previously created components.

This setup should allow for dynamic creation of your `WorkItemComponent` while properly passing in the `outletInfo` as expected.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":10547,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3430,""usageInWh"":2.1137}","ab0bf7ac-91e8-4871-9017-f47076a8f112","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-25T05:53:53.3691963Z","rdhqALeKrF7OAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7OAAAAAAAAAA==/","""44015b70-0000-1600-0000-685b8f2b0000""","attachments/","1750830891"

This is often used for lazy-loading modules in Angular. Below is the modified version of your code to dynamically import the `WorkItemModule` before creating the `WorkItemComponent`.

### Step 1: Modify the Code to Dynamically Import WorkItemModule

Here's an example of how you can achieve this with the dynamic import:

```typescript
import { ViewContainerRef, createEnvironmentInjector, inject } from '@angular/core';

// Assuming this code snippet is part of a function or method within a component or service
const viewContainerRef = inject(ViewContainerRef);

// Dynamically import the WorkItemModule and then create the component
import('src/app/modules/work-item/work-item.module').then(({ WorkItemModule }) => {
  
  // Create an environment injector to pass data into the WorkItemComponent
  const envInjector = createEnvironmentInjector(
      [
          {
              provide: 'workItemInfo', // Token for dependency injection
              useValue: this.outletInfo // The data you want to pass in
          },
      ],
      this.injector // The parent injector context
  );

  // Clear the ViewContainerRef to ensure no previous instances exist
  viewContainerRef.clear();

  // Create the WorkItemComponent dynamically
  const componentFactory = viewContainerRef.createComponent(WorkItemComponent, {
      environmentInjector: envInjector // Pass the environment injector
  });

  // Optional: You can handle the created component instance if needed
  const instance = componentFactory.instance;
});
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Dynamic Import**: 
   - The `import()` function is used to dynamically load the `WorkItemModule`. This returns a promise that you can then resolve to obtain the module.
  
2. **Using the Environment Injector**:
   - As before, you create an environment injector to provide any necessary dependencies to the component you're about to create.
   - You configure it with a provided value (`this.outletInfo`) for the token `'workItemInfo'`.

3. **ViewContainerRef**:
   - You clear the `ViewContainerRef` to avoid conflicts with any previously created components.

4. **Creating the Component**:
   - Finally, the `WorkItemComponent` is created using the `createComponent` method, with the `environmentInjector` passed in.

### Note

To make this work:

- **Ensure Proper Module Exports**: Confirm that `WorkItemComponent` is properly exported from the `WorkItemModule`.
- **Lazy Loading**: Using dynamic imports allows you to lazy-load components and modules, improving your application's performance by reducing the initial load time.
- **Handling Promises**: Make sure to handle any errors that may arise from the dynamic import properly in a production application.

### Additional Considerations

If you need to access the actual component type—`WorkItemComponent`—from the dynamically imported module, you'll typically have to export that component from the module like so:

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [WorkItemComponent],
  imports: [CommonModule],
  exports: [WorkItemComponent] // Make sure to export the component here
})
export class WorkItemModule {}
```

You can also organize the structure if you're planning to use many dynamic imports, potentially making it cleaner based on your project needs.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":11275,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3432,""usageInWh"":2.1871}","ffd15379-7d0d-4951-8e30-0ea73c772dcd","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-25T05:58:17.8311283Z","rdhqALeKrF7RAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7RAAAAAAAAAA==/","""4401d48b-0000-1600-0000-685b900b0000""","attachments/","1750831115"

This typically means that `inject()` is being called in a function outside of Angular's DI context, such as within a promise or outside the lifecycle hooks or constructors where DI addresses are available.

### Solution

To dynamically import and create a component while still being able to use `inject()`, the best approach is to wrap the import and subsequent actions in an Angular lifecycle method or in a method that is called in that context. This ensures that the required injection context is available.

Here's how you can modify your code:

1. **Wrap the dynamic import and component creation in a method of the component or inside a lifecycle hook.**
2. **Use `inject()` within the appropriate scope.**

### Updated Example

Let's say you want to create a method within an Angular component where you'll dynamically import `WorkItemModule` and create `WorkItemComponent`. Here's how to do it correctly:

```typescript
import { Component, ViewContainerRef, inject, Injector } from '@angular/core';
import { createEnvironmentInjector } from '@angular/core';
import { WorkItemComponent } from 'src/app/modules/work-item/work-item.component'; // Import here if statically needed

@Component({
  selector: 'app-your-component',
  template: `<button (click)=""createWorkItemComponent()"">Add Work Item</button>`, // Button to trigger creation
})
export class YourComponent {
  outletInfo = { /* your data here */ }; // Replace with actual data

  constructor(private viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef, private injector: Injector) {}

  createWorkItemComponent() {
    // Use dynamic import
    import('src/app/modules/work-item/work-item.module').then(({ WorkItemModule }) => {
      // Create the environment injector for dependency injection
      const envInjector = createEnvironmentInjector(
        [
          {
            provide: 'workItemInfo', // Token for DI
            useValue: this.outletInfo, // Value to inject
          },
        ],
        this.injector // Parent injector context
      );

      this.viewContainerRef.clear(); // Clear previous components

      // Dynamically create the WorkItemComponent
      const componentRef = this.viewContainerRef.createComponent(WorkItemComponent, {
        environmentInjector: envInjector,
      });

      // Optional: Do something with the component instance here
      const instance = componentRef.instance;
      console.log('Component created:', instance);
    }).catch(err => {
      console.error('Error loading module:', err); // Handle import errors
    });
  }
}
```

### Key Changes and Explanation:

1. **Injection Context**: The `inject()` function is called within the constructor and methods of the Angular component class, ensuring that it has the correct injection context.

2. **Dynamic Import**: The import of `WorkItemModule` is wrapped in the `createWorkItemComponent` method, so you ensure that everything is executed in a context where Angular's DI is available.

3. **Error Handling**: Made sure to catch errors that can occur during the asynchronous import of the module.

### Alternative Without Static Import:

If `WorkItemComponent` is not needed statically, but you only want to import it dynamically, you can remove the static import and just ensure you're dealing with the component inside the dynamic import:

- You would then need to reference `WorkItemComponent` after importing it dynamically similarly to how you interact with `WorkItemModule`.

This structure will help prevent errors related to injection contexts and allow dynamic loading of components and modules as intended.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":12032,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3801,""usageInWh"":2.3735}","08f80942-6a46-45ee-96c9-53e9a93c0dd8","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-25T06:04:30.5897106Z","rdhqALeKrF7SAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7SAAAAAAAAAA==/","""4401e5bc-0000-1600-0000-685b917d0000""","attachments/","1750831485"

However, you can achieve a similar result by utilizing `ng-content` for content projection and structuring your component to accept content. Here's how you can achieve what you're trying to do without requiring an explicit input for the template reference:

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Component Setup for Content Projection:**

   You would need to modify your component (`<app-dropdown-menu>`) to accept projected content rather than relying solely on a template reference input.

   ```typescript
   // dropdown-menu.component.ts
   import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-dropdown-menu',
     template: `
       <div class=""dropdown"">
         <button class=""dropdown-toggle"">{{ title }}</button>
         <div class=""dropdown-menu"">
           <ng-container *ngFor=""let item of rowItems"">
             <ng-content select=""[rowItemTemplate]""></ng-content>
           </ng-container>
         </div>
       </div>
     `
   })
   export class DropdownMenuComponent {
     @Input() title: string;
     @Input() rowItems: any[];
   }
   ```

2. **Use in Parent Component:**

   When using the `<app-dropdown-menu>`, you can insert your template directly into the component's content.

   ```html
   <app-dropdown-menu [title]=""menuTitle"" [rowItems]=""pets"">
     <ng-template ngProjectAs=""[rowItemTemplate]"" let-pet>
       <span>{{ pet.name | titlecase }}</span>
     </ng-template>
   </app-dropdown-menu>
   ```

### Explanation:

- **`ngProjectAs` Attribute:** You can use `ngProjectAs` to project specific content into a place expected by `ng-content` in the child component. This attribute essentially provides an alias to match child content to parent projections.

- **`ng-content`:** This allows the content to be projected into specific parts of a template, which in this case is determined by the `[rowItemTemplate]` attribute selector to align with the `ng-container` inside the component.

### Note:

This setup requires that the component correctly utilizes `ng-content` to manage the template content projection. You need to ensure no syntax errors exist in the usage and that Angular recognizes `ngProjectAs` properly in the relevant versions. This solution allows you to have the template logic handled directly within Angular's projection without passing a template reference directly as an input property.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":78,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2574,""usageInWh"":1.356}","bb9fa093-66e8-4d4c-9a39-ee585e633dd5","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-25T07:09:13.7691138Z","rdhqALeKrF7TAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7TAAAAAAAAAA==/","""46017ca1-0000-1600-0000-685ba0c40000""","attachments/","1750835396"

In that scenario, each `ng-template` content projection would not automatically have access to the component's variables, such as `pet`, unless explicitly passed and handled.

To properly bind data to a template projected using `ng-content`, you need to pass the data explicitly in the context where the `ng-content` gets processed. The `ngProjectAs` attribute is mainly useful for CSS-style projection using selectors and doesn't provide direct support for data binding.

Unfortunately, `ng-content` does not support binding variables directly like `<ng-template>`. Therefore, you must use different means to bind dynamic data like `let-pet` to each template instance.

### Revised Approach

Given the restrictions, it might be better to refactor the `<app-dropdown-menu>` component to specifically handle templates with inputs. The typical approach involves using `<ng-template>` with `TemplateRef` and `ng-container` for dynamically applying the template:

1. **Modify the Child Component:**

   Use the `TemplateRef` input property to apply the template, allowing the component to control the context in which the template is used.

   ```typescript
   // dropdown-menu.component.ts
   import { Component, Input, TemplateRef } from '@angular/core';

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-dropdown-menu',
     template: `
       <div class=""dropdown"">
         <button class=""dropdown-toggle"">{{ title }}</button>
         <div class=""dropdown-menu"">
           <ng-container *ngFor=""let item of rowItems"">
             <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet=""rowItemTemplate; context: {$implicit: item}""></ng-container>
           </ng-container>
         </div>
       </div>
     `
   })
   export class DropdownMenuComponent {
     @Input() title: string;
     @Input() rowItems: any[];
     @Input() rowItemTemplate: TemplateRef<any>;
   }
   ```

2. **Use in the Parent Component:**

   Pass the template to the child using `ng-template` and refer to it with `TemplateRef`.

   ```html
   <app-dropdown-menu [title]=""menuTitle"" [rowItems]=""pets"" [rowItemTemplate]=""petTemplate"">
   </app-dropdown-menu>

   <ng-template #petTemplate let-pet>
     <span>{{ pet.name | titlecase }}</span>
   </ng-template>
   ```

### What Happens Here:

- **TemplateRef Usage:** The `rowItemTemplate` input accepts a `TemplateRef`. It's used in a `ngTemplateOutlet` directive to render the template for each item in `rowItems`.

- **Context Passing:** The `ngTemplateOutlet` uses a context object which injects `item` into the template as `$implicit`. This allows you to access the `pet` variable as designed, enabling `pet.name` to function as expected.

This setup supports dynamic content rendering while maintaining the ability to pass arbitrary templates with local variables to your component.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":621,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2878,""usageInWh"":1.60335}","a04e47ec-bcb3-435e-bd51-70dc0a1c0329","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-25T07:10:51.7050698Z","rdhqALeKrF7UAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7UAAAAAAAAAA==/","""4601f8a9-0000-1600-0000-685ba10a0000""","attachments/","1750835466"

Diese Plattformen bieten oft flexible Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten, nachhaltige Optionen und eine breite Auswahl an Produkten, vergleichbar mit Liberty Stiftung.

Hier einige Alternativen:

### 1. **Vorsorge24.ch (Vorsorgeplattform der Privatbank Credit Suisse)**
- Bietet die Möglichkeit, verschiedene Produkte und Anbieter auf einer Plattform zu vergleichen und zu kombinieren.
- Fokus auf individuelle Beratung und flexible Lösungen.

### 2. **SimplyVorsorge (Verbund unabhängiger Anbieter)**
- Eine Plattform, die Produkte verschiedener Partner (Versicherungen, Banken) in einer Übersicht bündelt.
- Ermöglicht die Zusammenstellung einer individuellen Säule 3a inkl. verschiedener Anlagemöglichkeiten.

### 3. **Vorsorgestiftung oder unabhängige Beratungstools (z.B. VZ VermögensZentrum)**
- Manche Plattformen und Beratungstools erlauben, Produkte von mehreren Anbietern zu kombinieren, um eine maßgeschneiderte Vorsorgelösung zu schaffen.

### 4. **Fondskonzept Plattformen (z.B. Finpension, True Wealth, Selma)**
- Während diese Plattformen eher auf kostengünstige, online verwaltete Anlagekonten spezialisiert sind, bieten sie auch die Möglichkeit, Produkte verschiedener Anbieter zu integrieren und eine individuell gestaltete Vorsorgelösung zu erhalten.

### 5. **Selbstverwaltete Säule 3a-Lösungen via Drittanbieter (z.B. MyFundControl, VZ VermögensZentrum)**
- Hier können Sie Produkte verschiedener Anbieter auswählen, kombinieren und selbst verwalten — ähnlich der Liberty Stiftung.

### Was macht diese Plattformen aus?
- **Unabhängigkeit:** Produkte verschiedener Anbieter unter einem Dach
- **Flexibilität:** Auswahl und Kombination nach individuellen Bedürfnissen
- **Transparenz:** Vergleich von Gebühren, Renditen und nachhaltigen Optionen
- **Vereinfachung:** Alles in einer Schnittstelle, oft inklusive Beratung oder Simulation

### Fazit
Während die Liberty Stiftung in Schwyz eine relativ einzigartige Lösung bietet, gibt es in der Schweiz mehrere Anbieter und Plattformen, die einen vergleichbaren Ansatz verfolgen: Mehranbieterprodukte in einer Plattform, individuelle Gestaltungsmöglichkeit, transparent und flexibel. Empfehlenswert ist, die Angebote im Detail zu vergleichen und je nach Prioritäten (z.B. Nachhaltigkeit, Kosten, Flexibilität) abzuwägen.

Wenn Sie konkreten Bedarf oder spezielle Wünsche haben, kann eine individuelle Beratung durch einen unabhängigen Finanzexperten oder eine Plattform mit unabhängigen Vergleichstools helfen, die beste Lösung zu finden.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":579,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2812,""usageInWh"":0.65605}","c4971929-f223-47d6-800f-5c0596d1e531","a31b03cff7ce4570a611100887b0c69f","2025-06-25T08:11:19.0513978Z","rdhqALeKrF7XAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7XAAAAAAAAAA==/","""48019372-0000-1600-0000-685baf430000""","attachments/","1750839107"

Hier sind die wichtigsten:

1. **Reduzierte Leistung:** Das Gerät oder Fahrzeug arbeitet möglicherweise mit geringerer Leistung, was sich bei Aufgaben, die hohe Energie oder Leistung erfordern, negativ auswirken kann.

2. **Eingeschränkte Funktionen:** Manche Funktionen oder Features werden im Energiesparmodus deaktiviert oder eingeschränkt, was die Nutzung weniger komfortabel macht.

3. **Verlangsamte Reaktionszeiten:** Das System kann länger brauchen, um zu reagieren, da es darauf ausgelegt ist, Energie zu sparen, und nicht die maximale Geschwindigkeit oder Reaktionsfähigkeit zu bieten.

4. **Vermeintliche Leistungsbegrenzung:** Für bestimmte Anwendungen, wie z.B. beim Laptop, kann die Akkulaufzeit verlängert werden, aber die Gesamtleistung wird vermindert, was bei anspruchsvoller Nutzung störend sein kann.

5. **Potenzielle Beeinträchtigung der Benutzererfahrung:** Wenn der Energiesparmodus zu aggressiv eingestellt ist, können beispielsweise Bildschärfe, Helligkeit oder Soundqualität eingeschränkt werden.

6. **Kurzfristige Einsparungen, langfristige Einschränkungen:** Obwohl der Energiesparmodus Energie spart, kann eine längere Nutzung dazu führen, dass bestimmte Aufgaben langsamer erledigt werden, was bei bestimmten Anwendungen zeitaufwändig sein kann.

Je nachdem, was du genau nutzt (z.B. Laptop, Smartphone, Fahrzeug), können die Nachteile variieren. Es ist oft hilfreich, den Energiesparmodus nur dann zu aktivieren, wenn die Akkulaufzeit maximiert werden soll, und im Alltag auf volle Leistung zu setzen.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":28,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1636,""usageInWh"":0.37052}","46e40f17-c3b7-4fb1-bba1-8b24fdc09bbd","de3e3163a6e04819a87f34df897f78aa","2025-06-25T08:38:43.7986878Z","rdhqALeKrF7ZAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7ZAAAAAAAAAA==/","""49018f3e-0000-1600-0000-685bb5b10000""","attachments/","1750840753"

Bei Wix kann es manchmal vorkommen, dass bestimmte Elemente, wie Vektors, an Rasterlinien, Ankerpunkten oder ""Magneten"" ausgerichtet sind, was das Feinjustieren erschwert. Hier sind einige Tipps, um das Problem zu lösen:

1. **Ausrichtungssperren deaktivieren:**  
   - Klicke auf das Element, bei dem das Magnetverhalten auftritt.  
   - Oben in der Toolbar sollte eine Option wie „Ausrichtung an Raster“ oder „Magnet aktiv“ (meist als Magnet-Symbol dargestellt) sichtbar sein.  
   - Diese Option kannst du deaktivieren, um das Element frei zu drehen, ohne an Raster oder Ankerpunkte zu haften.

2. **Raster- und Ausrichtungsoptionen ausschalten:**  
   - Gehe auf „Einstellungen“ > „Raster & Linien“ oder „Gitter“ in der linken Sidebar.  
   - Deaktiviere „Raster auf Maskierung“ oder „Ausrichten am Raster“, falls aktiviert.

3. **Feinjustierung im Rotations-Panel:**  
   - Wenn du das Element auswählst, kannst du im Eigenschaftenfenster die Drehung präzise einstellen, z.B. im Rotationsfeld die Gradzahl manuell eingeben (z.B. 3 Grad).  
   - So kannst du das Element exakt in der gewünschten Position drehen, ohne dass es springt.

4. **Freie Rotation versuchen:**  
   - Wenn die Drehung nur über das Ziehen an der Ecke des Elements funktioniert, halte die Shift-Taste gedrückt, während du drehst. Das kann manchmal die Magnetfunktion umgehen.

5. **Zoom-Faktor verändern:**  
   - Manchmal hilft es, den Zoomfaktor in Wix zu erhöhen, um feinere Ausrichtung zu ermöglichen.

---

**Kurzfassung:**  
Schalte die Magnet- bzw. Rasterfunktion aus, indem du das Magnet-Symbol in der Toolbar deaktivierst, oder in den Raster- und Hilfslinieneinstellungen. Danach kannst du das Element präziser drehen.

In Wix kann es manchmal tatsächlich sein, dass bestimmte Funktionen wie Magneten oder Anker eine Feineinstellung beim Drehen erschweren, und die üblichen Einstellungen sind nicht immer intuitiv sichtbar. Hier sind einige weitere Tipps, die dir helfen könnten:

1. **Rotation mit dem Einstellungsfenster:**
   - Wähle das Vector-Element aus.
   - Klicke in der Eigenschaftenleiste auf das Rotationssymbol oder das Drehwerkzeug.
   - Gib dort manuell die gewünschte Gradzahl ein (z.B. 3°). Das umgeht das Ziehen und mögliche „Springen“.

2. **Verwende das Tastatur-Feintuning:**
   - Wenn du das Element auswählst, kannst du in einigen Wix-Editoren mit den Pfeiltasten (bei gedrückter Shift-Taste) die Rotation feiner einstellen.
   - Ansonsten kannst du beim Eingeben eine Dezimalstelle verwenden, z.B. 3,0°, um eine genauere Einstellung zu erhalten.

3. **Raster- und Linealeinstellungen:**
   - Auch wenn du sagst, diese sind nicht sichtbar, versuche mal, in den Editor-Einstellungen oder im Menü „Ansicht“ nach „Lineale“ oder „Hilfslinien“ zu suchen und diese auszuschalten, um das Element frei zu drehen.

4. **Layout- und Anker-Eigenschaften überprüfen:**
   - Manchmal sind Vektoren in Wix als „inline“ oder „fest geparkt“ eingestellt, was das Rotieren beeinflusst. Stelle sicher, dass sie auf „frei“ oder „positioniert“ stehen und nicht an einem Ankerpunkt hängen.

5. **Vektorelemente neu erstellen:**
   - Falls nichts hilft, könntest du versuchen, das Vector-Element zu löschen und neu zu erstellen, ggf. in einer neuen Ebene, um das Magnetverhalten zu umgehen.

---

Shift-Taste zum exakten Drehen) für das Rotieren von Elementen direkt im Editor. Allerdings kannst du einige Methoden verwenden, um die Rotation präziser durchzuführen:

**Möglichkeiten für präziseres Drehen in Wix:**

1. **Manuelle Eingabe des Rotationswinkels:**
   - Wähle das Vector- oder anderes Element aus.
   - Gehe in die Eigenschaften (Eigenschaftsfenster).
   - Dort kannst du in das Rotationsfeld eine genaue Gradzahl eingeben, z.B. `3`, `3.0`, `-3` usw.
   - Das ermöglicht eine exakte Rotation ohne Magnete.

2. **Raster und Hilfslinien aktivieren/deaktivieren:**
   - Über das Menü „Ansicht“ kannst du Raster, Hilfslinien und Magnetfunktion aktivieren/deaktivieren.
   - Das erleichtert das präzise Platzieren und Drehen.

3. **Tastatureingaben bei der Rotation:**
   - Bisher ist bekannt, dass Wix keine Tastenkürzel wie Shift für das restriktive Drehen (z.B. in 15° Schritten) bietet.
   - Man kann allerdings beim Rotieren mit der Maus versuchen, die linke Maustaste gedrückt zu halten und die Shift-Taste zu verwenden, um das Drehen auf bestimmte Achsen zu beschränken — allerdings ist das oft weniger präzise als die manuelle Eingabe.

4. **Verwendung von Diagramm-Tools (z.B. in Editor X):**
   - In Editor X gibt es erweiterte Steuerungsmöglichkeiten, aber in klassischem Wix-Editor eher weniger.

**Fazit:**  
Es gibt kein direktes Tastenkürzel wie Shift, um in Wix beim Drehen zu „snap“ (einrasten) oder auf exakte Winkel zu springen. Die präziseste Methode ist immer noch, die Drehung per Eingabefeld festzulegen.

Wenn du regelmäßig präzise Drehungen machen musst, empfehle ich, die Rotation im Eigenschaftenfenster genau einzugeben.

Es tut mir leid, dass die genannten Möglichkeiten nicht wie beschrieben funktionieren. In Wix gibt es in der Tat keine standardmäßigen Tastenkürzel wie Shift, um beim Drehen von Elementen im Editor die Rotation auf bestimmte Winkel oder in Schritten zu beschränken.

**Aktuelle Situation in Wix:**
- Beim Ziehen und Drehen eines Elements mit der Maus kannst du versuchen, die Shift-Taste zu verwenden, um das Element zu arretieren. Allerdings unterstützt Wix diese Funktion nicht standardmäßig.
- Das rotieren per manuelle Eingabe ist möglich, aber eine Rotation beim Ziehen wird nicht durch Tastenkombinationen beeinflusst.

**Was du tun kannst:**
- **Rotation anhand der Eigenschaften manuell eingeben:** Das ist die einzige zuverlässige Methode, um eine exakte Rotation zu erreichen.
- **Ausrichtung per Raster:** Aktiviere Rasterlinien und Magnetfunktion in den Ansichtsoptionen, um Elemente präzise auszurichten, auch beim Drehen.
- **Externe Tools:** Falls du regelmäßig sehr präzise Rotation benötigst, könnte es sinnvoll sein, Grafiken in einem Programm wie Photoshop vorzubereiten und fertig ausgerichtet in Wix hochzuladen.

**Fazit:**  
Bis heute gibt es in Wix keinen Shortcut, der die Rotation beim Element mit Shift oder anderen Tasten einschränkt oder anpasst.

### 1. **Hervorhebung der Frage im Design**

- **Große Schriftgröße:** Verwende eine große, leicht lesbare Schriftart, damit die Frage sofort ins Auge fällt.
- **Fettdruck oder besondere Schriftart:** Nutze eine Schriftart und Schriftstil (z.B. fett), die die Aufmerksamkeit maximieren.
- **Hintergrund und Farben:** Wähle kontrastreiche Farben für den Text im Vergleich zum Hintergrund (z.B. dunkler Text auf hellem Hintergrund oder umgekehrt).
- **Animationen:** Füge einen leichten Fade-in oder Puls-Animation hinzu, damit die Frage dynamisch ins Blickfeld rückt.

### 2. **Platzierung auf der Startseite**

- **Obere Drittel:** Platziere die Frage im oberen Bereich der Startseite, z.B. im hero-Abschnitt (Anschnitt „Header“ oder „Hero Section“), damit sie sofort sichtbar ist.
- **Zentrierung:** Zentriere die Frage auf der Seite, um den Fokus darauf zu lenken.

### 3. **Verwendung eines speziellen Elements**

- **Box oder Banner:** Stelle die Frage in eine auffällige Box oder ein Banner mit einer Farbe, die vom Rest abhebt.
- **Icons oder visuelle Elemente:** Ergänze die Frage durch passende Icons, z.B. eine Sprechblase, Fragezeichen oder eine farbige Lichtlinie.

### 4. **Textgestaltung und -formulierung**

- **Klare, prägnante Formulierung:** Stelle die Frage als direkten, ansprechenden Satz dar, z.B.:
  - „Bibel-Treff Rothrist – Sind Sie neugierig?“
  - „Wollen Sie mehr über den Bibel-Treff Rothrist erfahren?“
  - Oder noch einfacher: „Bibel-Treff Rothrist? – Finden Sie hier die Antwort.“

### 5. **Interaktive Elemente**

- **Button oder Link:** Ergänze einen auffälligen Button „Mehr erfahren“ oder „Besuchen Sie uns“, der direkt unter der Frage platziert ist, um die Besucher zum Handeln zu bewegen.
- **Hover-Effekte:** Nutze Hover-Effekte, die beim Überfahren mit der Maus die Frage hervorheben.

### Umsetzung in Wix

In Wix kannst du diese Tipps folgendermaßen umsetzen:

1. **Abschnitt hinzufügen:** Füge im Editor einen „Hero“-Abschnitt oder einen Abschnitt mit Vollbild-Hintergrund hinzu.
2. **Text hinzufügen:** Ziehe ein Text-Element in den Bereich und schreibe deine Frage.
3. **Design anpassen:** Ändere Schriftgröße, Schriftart, Farbe und Ausrichtung im Text-Editor.
4. **Hintergrund oder Box:** Füge bei Bedarf eine farbige Box hinter den Text hinzu (über „Hintergrund“ oder als dekoratives Element).
5. **Animation einfügen:** Wähle das Text-Element aus, klicke auf „Animationen“ und wähle eine passende Animation.
6. **Buttons ergänzen:** Füge einen Button hinzu, gestalte ihn auffällig und platziere ihn passend.

Alternativ kann die Abfotografieren des Bildschirms mit einer Kamera oder die Nutzung von Screenshot-Funktionen auf dem Gerät eine bessere Lösung sein, um den Bildschirminhalt digital festzuhalten.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":10,""numberOfOutputTokens"":756,""usageInWh"":0.41726}","1d9b236f-337b-4539-901a-91c72cceec6b","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-25T10:57:53.353867Z","rdhqALeKrF7kAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7kAAAAAAAAAA==/","""4d01fc37-0000-1600-0000-685bd6380000""","attachments/","1750849080"

The primary issue here seems to be with how `switchMap` is being used. The `switchMap` expects a single observable to be returned, but it looks like you are trying to combine two. You should probably use `forkJoin`, `combineLatest`, or another operator to handle multiple observables. Here's a revised version of your code:

```typescript
load: rxMethod<number>(
  pipe(
    debounceTime(250),
    tap(() => setLoading(true)),
    switchMap(id =>
      combineLatest([
        dataPointService.getBayLiveMeasurementsForSchemaByNodeId({ nodeId: id }).pipe(
          tapResponse({
            next: liveMeasurements => setMeasurements(liveMeasurements),
            error: handleError
          })
        ),
        topologyService.getSchema({ id: id }).pipe(
          tapResponse({
            next: setDateil,
            error: handleError
          })
        )
      ])
    )
  )
)
```

### Explanation:

- **`combineLatest`:** This operator is used to combine multiple observables. It waits for all sources to emit at least one value and then emits the latest values from each source whenever any of them emits.
  
- **`tapResponse`:** This seems like a custom operator that you're using to handle the response in both success and error scenarios. Make sure it's correctly implemented to handle both observable outputs in the revised logic.

This revision assumes that both service calls in `switchMap` should happen in parallel and that you want to handle their responses simultaneously. Adjust `combineLatest` to another operator like `forkJoin` or `mergeMap` if your use case is different.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":120,""numberOfOutputTokens"":1743,""usageInWh"":0.93933}","c04e5335-bdc1-45c9-8892-7df7127c8930","c2b2a951774a41c283448dcc9bec891e","2025-06-25T10:59:01.6041094Z","rdhqALeKrF7lAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7lAAAAAAAAAA==/","""5301df98-0000-1600-0000-685c0b6c0000""","attachments/","1750862700"

Hier sind mögliche Gründe, warum dein gewünschtes Bild nicht als Thumbnail angezeigt wird:

1. **LinkedIn unterstützt keine manuelle Thumbnail-Auswahl für Videos:**  
   Im Gegensatz zu Plattformen wie YouTube gibt LinkedIn bei der Video-Upload-Option nur begrenzte Möglichkeiten, ein individuelles Thumbnail auszuwählen. Oft wird automatisch das erste Frame des Videos als Vorschau gezeigt.

2. **Vorschaubild beim Video-Upload ist nur bei bestimmten Formaten verfügbar:**  
   Manchmal kann man beim Hochladen eines Videos eine separate Bilddatei hochladen, die als Vorschau angezeigt wird. Falls du das gemacht hast, ist es möglich, dass LinkedIn dieses Bild nicht als Thumbnail übernimmt, sondern das Video-Frame.

3. **Automatische Vorschau im Algorithmus priorisiert:**  
   LinkedIn kann für die Vorschau automatische Frames auswählen, die für den Algorithmus am attraktivsten sind, auch wenn du ein anderes Bild hochgeladen hast.

4. **Fehlende Synchronisation zwischen Upload-Tools und LinkedIn:**  
   Falls du externe Tools (z. B. Social Media Manager, Video-Editoren) benutzt hast, um das Video mit einem Thumbnail zu versehen, wird dies möglicherweise nicht von LinkedIn unterstützt.

**Was kannst du tun?**  
- **Testweise das Video neu hochladen:** Versuche, das Video ohne zusätzliche Bilder hochzuladen und prüfe, ob LinkedIn das erste Frame verwendet.  
- **Druck auf das Thumbnail durch obenstehendes Bild:** Falls du bei einer Videoanzeige eine Vorschau im Feed möchtest, kannst du nach dem Hochladen im Beitrag noch versuchen, den Vorschaubereifen zu ändern (falls diese Funktion bei deinem Post möglich ist).  
- **Verwende Plattformen wie YouTube oder Vimeo:** Wenn du das Video vorab auf eine Plattform mit mehr Kontrolle über Thumbnails hochlädst und dann den Link teilst, kannst du ein benutzerdefiniertes Thumbnail auswählen.

**Kurz gesagt:**  
LinkedIn übernimmt in der Regel das erste Frame des Videos als Vorschau, wenn kein individuelles Thumbnail festgelegt wurde. Das Setzen eines separaten Vorschaubildes beim Hochladen ist oftmals nicht ausreichend, um dieses als Thumbnail zu verwenden.

Wenn du weiterhin eine spezifische Vorschau möchtest, ist der **beste Weg**, das Video auf einer Plattform mit genauer Thumbnail-Option hochzuladen und dann den Link auf LinkedIn zu teilen.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":174,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2608,""usageInWh"":0.58486}","d118890b-64f2-4536-8d8a-13173eeb98af","de3e3163a6e04819a87f34df897f78aa","2025-06-25T11:58:44.8969732Z","rdhqALeKrF7oAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7oAAAAAAAAAA==/","""4e01aaf9-0000-1600-0000-685be4a70000""","attachments/","1750852775"

### Gründe, warum ein anderes Frame als Vorschau angezeigt wird:

1. **Automatische Vorschau-Auswahl durch LinkedIn**:  
   LinkedIn wählt für die Video-Vorschau oft automatisch das Frame, das sie für am ansprechendsten halten – also ein Frame, das am besten zur Aufmerksamkeit passt. Es ist also nicht immer das erste Frame, das angezeigt wird, selbst wenn du ein anderes Bild hochgeladen hast.

2. **Eingeschränkte Steuerung beim Hochladen**:  
   Im Gegensatz zu Plattformen wie YouTube oder Vimeo unterstützt LinkedIn meist keine direkte Auswahl des Thumbnails beim Video-Upload. Das Bild, das du hochlädst, wird möglicherweise nur für andere Zwecke (z. B. Vorschau im Beitrag) verwendet, nicht aber für das Vorschaubild des Videos im Feed.

3. **Verarbeitung durch LinkedIn nach Upload**:  
   Nach dem Hochladen verarbeitet LinkedIn das Video, um eine Vorschau zu generieren. Dabei kann das System automatisch das Frame auswählen, das am prominentesten erscheint – oft das zweite oder dritte Frame, wenn es ""besser"" für die Vorschau erscheint.

4. **Bild- und Video-Frames unterscheiden sich**:  
   Wenn du das erste Frame des Videos durch ein Vorschaubild ersetzt hast, ist das nur innerhalb des Videos sichtbar. LinkedIn kann trotzdem auf das gleiche oder ein anderes Frame im Video zurückgreifen, um das Vorschau-Thumbnail zu generieren, wenn keine explizite manuelle Auswahl erfolgt.

### Was kannst du tun, um das gewünschte Vorschaubild zu gewährleisten?

- **Sicherstellen, dass das gewünschte Bild im Video an erster Stelle steht**:  
  Stelle sicher, dass das Bild, das du als Vorschaubild willst, im Video an erster Position ist. Wenn du es nur per Bilddatei hochgeladen hast, aber es nicht im Video integriert ist, übernimmt LinkedIn wahrscheinlich das erste Frame des eigentlichen Videos.

- **Video vor dem Hochladen entsprechend anpassen**:  
  Bearbeite dein Video so, dass dein spannendes Vorschaubild im ersten Frame enthalten ist, bevor du es hochlädst.

- **Manuelle Thumbnail-Auswahl bei anderen Plattformen**:  
  Nutze Plattformen, die eine direkte Auswahl des Thumbnails erlauben, und teile dann den Link (z. B. YouTube) auf LinkedIn.

- **Screenshot des gewünschten Frames hochladen** (wenn Plattform diese Option zulässt):  
  Manche Nutzer laden ein ""Vorschaubild"" separat hoch, um im Feed eine andere Vorschau anzuzeigen, aber diese wird oft nur bei Beiträgen, nicht bei Video-Posts übernommen.

---

### Fazit:
LinkedIn wählt selbst das Vorschau-Frame, meist das erste oder andere ""attraktivere"" Frame, basierend auf einer automatischen Auswahl. Das Hochladen eines Bildes in der Hoffnung, dass es als Vorschau genutzt wird, funktioniert oft nicht, weil das System das Video selbst für Vorschauen aussucht.

**Tipp:** Um sicherzugehen, dass dein gewünschtes Bild angezeigt wird, integriere es ins Video an erster Stelle, bevor du es hochlädst.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":650,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3119,""usageInWh"":0.72549}","0c0001ba-54c5-444e-8f67-3fcbec68cc5d","de3e3163a6e04819a87f34df897f78aa","2025-06-25T12:04:30.6729114Z","rdhqALeKrF7pAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7pAAAAAAAAAA==/","""4f01d821-0000-1600-0000-685be5d70000""","attachments/","1750853079"

","1","gpt-4o-mini","5","true","2025-06-25T12:29:19.500311Z","To implement the `ngOnDestroy` lifecycle method in your `EntityPreviewComponent`, we need to clean up any resources that were allocated during the component's lifecycle. Typically, this includes:

1. **Destroying any dynamically created components** to prevent memory leaks.
2. **Cleaning up any subscriptions** (if applicable).
3. **De-referencing/clearing any references** to objects or modules that won’t be used anymore.

In your case, since you're dynamically creating a component using `ViewContainerRef`, we should ensure that any created components are destroyed when the `EntityPreviewComponent` is destroyed.

Here’s how you can implement `ngOnDestroy` to clean up your component:

### Implementation of `ngOnDestroy`

```typescript
ngOnDestroy(): void {
    console.log('EntityPreviewComponent destroyed');

    // Clear the ViewContainerRef if there are child components created
    if (this.entityTemplate) {
        this.entityTemplate.clear(); // This will destroy any components in the view container
    }

    // Additional cleanup (if you had subscriptions, etc.):
    // if (this.someSubscription) {
    //     this.someSubscription.unsubscribe();
    // }

    // Nullify references for garbage collection
    this.entityComponent = null;
    this.moduleRef = null; 
    this.childInjector = null; 
}
```

### Key Points for Cleanup

1. **Clear the ViewContainerRef**:
   - The call to `this.entityTemplate.clear()` will destroy all components that were created within that `ViewContainerRef`, which is important for preventing memory leaks.

2. **Clear References**:
   - Setting `this.entityComponent`, `this.moduleRef`, and `this.childInjector` to `null` helps clear references. This is useful if your component has strong references that could prevent garbage collection. Although in most cases, clearing the container will suffice, it's a good practice to reset used properties.

3. **Unsubscribe from Services (if needed)**:
   - If you have any observables or services where subscriptions were made, be sure to properly unsubscribe from them to prevent any potential leaks. I have included commented code to illustrate this point.

### Example Cleaned-Up Component

Here’s the complete example with `ngOnDestroy` implemented:

            [
                {
                    provide: 'outletInfo',
                    useValue: this.outletInfo
                },

        console.log('EntityPreviewComponent destroyed');

        // Clear the ViewContainerRef if there are child components created
        if (this.entityTemplate) {
            this.entityTemplate.clear(); // This will destroy any components in the view container
        }

        // Cleanup references
        this.entityComponent = null;
        this.moduleRef = null; 
        this.childInjector = null; 
    }
}
```

By adding the `ngOnDestroy` method, you'll ensure that your component cleans up any dynamically created resources properly when it is destroyed, which helps maintain optimal performance and prevents memory leaks in your Angular application.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":4416,""numberOfOutputTokens"":4827,""usageInWh"":1.9197}","db8ccc27-6ff1-43a5-a9a9-6a3f4c2272c5","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-25T12:29:06.091091Z","rdhqALeKrF7qAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7qAAAAAAAAAA==/","""4f0182d6-0000-1600-0000-685bebac0000""","attachments/","1750854572"

whats the issue?","2","gpt-4o","10","true","2025-06-25T12:58:14.7128128Z","The error message indicates that a unit test is expecting a specific method call (`SendAsync`) to be made exactly once with certain parameters, but this call is either not happening or not matching the expected parameters.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:

1. **Expected Call Specification**: The test expects a call to `SendAsync` with a parameter (likely an object or DTO) that matches a specific set of conditions:
   - `InitiatorRole` should be ""Advisor""
   - `IsCollectiveSignatory` should be true
   - `PartnerNumber` should be ""123456""
   - `ContactTypeId` should be 8
   - `ContactDateTime` should match a specific datetime
   - Other properties (`ContactPhoneNumber`, `Subject`, `Notes`, `BankRepresentatives`, `SubmittedBy`, `SubmittedOn`, `MeetingLocation`) all have specific expected values.
   
2. **Actual Call**: The error message states that there was one non-matching call to `SendAsync` with an argument marked with a wildcard (`*`), indicating that it doesn't match what was expected. The received call passed a `SendMultipleContactNotesRequestDto` object, implying there might be a mismatch in the expected object type or properties.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Mismatch in DTO/Object Type**: The object passed might not match the expected type or structure. It appears `SendAsync` received a `SendMultipleContactNotesRequestDto` instead of whatever the test expected (possibly a different DTO or specific property values).
   - **Incorrect Parameter Values**: Double-check the values being set in your DTO before calling `SendAsync`. Ensure they match the expected values in the test.
   - **Call Not Made**: Ensure that the method call is actually being made in your production code under the conditions of your test. There might be logic preventing it from running.

To resolve this issue:
- Review the code within `CreateContactNoteCommandHandlerTest` to ensure you are setting up the DTO with the expected properties.
- Confirm that the conditions lead to the `SendAsync` method execution.
- Evaluate the mock setup to ensure any dependencies are correctly configured.

Debugging this may also involve placing breakpoints or log statements to inspect the actual parameters being passed to `SendAsync` during the test's execution.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":489,""numberOfOutputTokens"":2260,""usageInWh"":1.26573}","4f94b210-80e2-4783-ba2d-d602574eb053","e6c6fdc37f5247779986718dd20d086e","2025-06-25T12:58:04.3514025Z","rdhqALeKrF7rAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7rAAAAAAAAAA==/","""50015aa6-0000-1600-0000-685bf2730000""","attachments/","1750856307"

However, you can work around this limitation by creating a method in your component class that performs these checks, which you can then call from the template.

### Step 1: Define Your Enum

First, let's assume you have an enum defined for your page states. Here's an example:

```typescript
export enum PageStates {
    LoadedWorkItem = 1 << 0, // 1
    LoadedAppointment = 1 << 1, // 2
    LoadedFile = 1 << 2, // 4
    LoadedUser = 1 << 3, // 8
    LoadedTeam = 1 << 4, // 16
    LoadedMeeting = 1 << 5, // 32
    LoadedDataObject = 1 << 6, // 64
    LoadedJob = 1 << 7, // 128
    LoadedConversation = 1 << 8, // 256
    LoadedTimeRecord = 1 << 9 // 512
}
```

### Step 2: Create a Method to Perform the Bitwise Check

Next, create a method in your Angular component that takes the current state and checks if it matches the combined states you're interested in:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { PageStates } from './your-enum-path'; // Adjust to your actual path

@Component({
  selector: 'app-your-component',
  templateUrl: './your-component.component.html',
})
export class YourComponent {
  currentState = PageStates.LoadedWorkItem | PageStates.LoadedFile; // Example current state

  // Method to check if current state matches the required combined states
  isCurrentStateValid(): boolean {
    const requiredStates = (
      PageStates.LoadedWorkItem |
      PageStates.LoadedAppointment |
      PageStates.LoadedFile |
      PageStates.LoadedUser |
      PageStates.LoadedTeam |
      PageStates.LoadedMeeting |
      PageStates.LoadedDataObject |
      PageStates.LoadedJob |
      PageStates.LoadedConversation |
      PageStates.LoadedTimeRecord
    );

    return (this.currentState & requiredStates) === this.currentState;
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Use the Method in Your Angular Template

You can then use the method in your template to determine whether or not to show certain content:

```html
<div *ngIf=""isCurrentStateValid()"">
  <!-- Your content that should only be shown when the current state matches -->
  <p>The current state includes the loaded work item, appointment, file, or other components.</p>
</div>
```

### Full Example

Putting it all together, here's how your component might look:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

export enum PageStates {
    LoadedWorkItem = 1 << 0,
    LoadedAppointment = 1 << 1,
    LoadedFile = 1 << 2,
    LoadedUser = 1 << 3,
    LoadedTeam = 1 << 4,
    LoadedMeeting = 1 << 5,
    LoadedDataObject = 1 << 6,
    LoadedJob = 1 << 7,
    LoadedConversation = 1 << 8,
    LoadedTimeRecord = 1 << 9
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-your-component',
  templateUrl: './your-component.component.html',
})
export class YourComponent {
  currentState = PageStates.LoadedWorkItem | PageStates.LoadedFile; // Example current state

  isCurrentStateValid(): boolean {
    const requiredStates = (
      PageStates.LoadedWorkItem |
      PageStates.LoadedAppointment |
      PageStates.LoadedFile |
      PageStates.LoadedUser |
      PageStates.LoadedTeam |
      PageStates.LoadedMeeting |
      PageStates.LoadedDataObject |
      PageStates.LoadedJob |
      PageStates.LoadedConversation |
      PageStates.LoadedTimeRecord
    );

    return (this.currentState & requiredStates) === this.currentState;
  }
}
```

### Template Example

And your component’s HTML template might include:

```html
<div *ngIf=""isCurrentStateValid()"">
  <!-- Content displayed when currentState is valid -->
  <p>Current state is valid and displayed!</p>
</div>
```

### Conclusion

By creating a method in your component, you simplify using complex bitwise operations in your templates. This approach allows for better maintainability and testing of your logic compared to embedding such calculations directly in the template.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":4685,""numberOfOutputTokens"":4026,""usageInWh"":1.7063}","e45d4e15-e123-4d69-be1b-116f67737145","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-25T13:01:13.9184348Z","rdhqALeKrF7sAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7sAAAAAAAAAA==/","""50011fc2-0000-1600-0000-685bf3500000""","attachments/","1750856528"

This way, you'll have calculated the result once when the state changes, and you can reference the property directly in the template.

### Step 1: Compute the Value in the Component

Instead of defining a method, you can compute the result directly within your component whenever `currentState` changes. You can use a getter to calculate the combined state, which simplifies the logic within your Angular template.

Here is an example of how you can achieve this:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

export enum PageStates {
    LoadedWorkItem = 1 << 0,
    LoadedAppointment = 1 << 1,
    LoadedFile = 1 << 2,
    LoadedUser = 1 << 3,
    LoadedTeam = 1 << 4,
    LoadedMeeting = 1 << 5,
    LoadedDataObject = 1 << 6,
    LoadedJob = 1 << 7,
    LoadedConversation = 1 << 8,
    LoadedTimeRecord = 1 << 9
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-your-component',
  templateUrl: './your-component.component.html',
})
export class YourComponent {
  currentState = PageStates.LoadedWorkItem | PageStates.LoadedFile; // Example current state

  // Create a getter to compute the valid state
  get isCurrentStateValid(): boolean {
    const requiredStates = (
      PageStates.LoadedWorkItem |
      PageStates.LoadedAppointment |
      PageStates.LoadedFile |
      PageStates.LoadedUser |
      PageStates.LoadedTeam |
      PageStates.LoadedMeeting |
      PageStates.LoadedDataObject |
      PageStates.LoadedJob |
      PageStates.LoadedConversation |
      PageStates.LoadedTimeRecord
    );

    return (this.currentState & requiredStates) === this.currentState;
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Use the Computed Property in Your Template

You can now leverage this getter directly in your template using property binding:

```html
<div *ngIf=""isCurrentStateValid"">
  <!-- Your content that should only be shown when the current state matches -->
  <p>The current state includes the loaded work item, appointment, file, or other components.</p>
</div>
```

### How This Works

- **Getter**: The `isCurrentStateValid` getter computes the value based on `currentState`. Since it's a property, you don't explicitly call it like a method, but Angular will access it as if it were a field.
- **Change Detection**: The getter will be recalculated when Angular's change detection runs and when `currentState` is updated, ensuring the template always reflects the current state.

### Full Updated Example

Here’s the complete example with the computed property:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

export enum PageStates {
    LoadedWorkItem = 1 << 0,
    LoadedAppointment = 1 << 1,
    LoadedFile = 1 << 2,
    LoadedUser = 1 << 3,
    LoadedTeam = 1 << 4,
    LoadedMeeting = 1 << 5,
    LoadedDataObject = 1 << 6,
    LoadedJob = 1 << 7,
    LoadedConversation = 1 << 8,
    LoadedTimeRecord = 1 << 9
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-your-component',
  templateUrl: './your-component.component.html',
})
export class YourComponent {
  currentState = PageStates.LoadedWorkItem | PageStates.LoadedFile; // Example current state

  // Getter to check if the current state is valid
  get isCurrentStateValid(): boolean {
    const requiredStates = (
      PageStates.LoadedWorkItem |
      PageStates.LoadedAppointment |
      PageStates.LoadedFile |
      PageStates.LoadedUser |
      PageStates.LoadedTeam |
      PageStates.LoadedMeeting |
      PageStates.LoadedDataObject |
      PageStates.LoadedJob |
      PageStates.LoadedConversation |
      PageStates.LoadedTimeRecord
    );

    return (this.currentState & requiredStates) === this.currentState;
  }
}
```

### Template Example

And your component’s HTML template will look like this:

```html
<div *ngIf=""isCurrentStateValid"">
  <!-- Content displayed when currentState is valid -->
  <p>Current state is valid and displayed!</p>
</div>
```

### Final Notes

Using a getter provides a clean and efficient way to evaluate conditions in the template without having to call a method directly. This leverages Angular's change detection capabilities while keeping your template concise and free from unnecessary method calls.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":4838,""numberOfOutputTokens"":4344,""usageInWh"":1.817}","db9a2ed3-4f8f-4d91-b361-13f5d334c0b5","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-25T13:02:38.9820555Z","rdhqALeKrF7tAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7tAAAAAAAAAA==/","""5001b6c9-0000-1600-0000-685bf3880000""","attachments/","1750856584"

This allows Angular to properly check the `outletType` against each case.

### Example Structure

Here's how you can set this up:

```html
<div [ngSwitch]=""outletType""> <!-- Assuming outletType is defined in your component -->
    <app-work-item *ngSwitchCase=""outletTypes.Workitem"" [workItemInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-work-item>
    
    <app-file *ngSwitchCase=""outletTypes.File"" [fileInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-file>
    
    <app-meeting *ngSwitchCase=""outletTypes.Meeting"" [meetingInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-meeting>
    
    <app-user *ngSwitchCase=""outletTypes.User"" [userInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-user>
    
    <app-team *ngSwitchCase=""outletTypes.Team"" [teamInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-team>
    
    <app-time-record *ngSwitchCase=""outletTypes.TimeRecord""></app-time-record>
    
    <app-calendar *ngSwitchCase=""outletTypes.Calendar"" [calendarInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-calendar>
    
    <app-user-resources *ngSwitchCase=""outletTypes.UserRessources"" [outletInfo]=""outletInfo"" [isDoubleClickEnabled]=""true""></app-user-resources>
    
    <app-data-object *ngSwitchCase=""outletTypes.DataObject"" [dataObjectInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-data-object>
    
    <app-appointment *ngSwitchCase=""outletTypes.Appointment"" [appointmentInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-appointment>
    
    <app-time-record-player *ngSwitchCase=""outletTypes.TimeRecordPlayer"" [playerInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-time-record-player>
    
    <!-- Optional: You can add a default case using ngSwitchDefault -->
    <ng-container *ngSwitchDefault>
        <p>No valid outlet type selected.</p>
    </ng-container>
</div>
```

### Explanation

1. **`ngSwitch` Directive**: The parent `<div>` element uses the `[ngSwitch]` directive to evaluate `outletType`. This should be a property defined in your component that specifies what type of outlet you are currently working with.

2. **`ngSwitchCase`**: Each `<app-component>` directive utilizes `*ngSwitchCase` to check if `outletType` matches one of the defined `outletTypes`. If it does, the corresponding component will be rendered with the appropriate input bindings.

3. **Inputs**: Each component gets its inputs (like `workItemInfo`, `fileInfo`, etc.) from `outletInfo`, which should also be defined in your component.

4. **Default Case**: The optional `ngSwitchDefault` can be provided to handle situations where none of the cases match, which can be useful for error handling or fallback UI.

### Full Example in the Component

Assuming your component looks something like this:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

// Define your outlet types (assuming your enum is set up like this)
export enum OutletTypes {
  Workitem,
  File,
  Meeting,
  User,
  Team,
  TimeRecord,
  Calendar,
  UserRessources,
  DataObject,
  Appointment,
  TimeRecordPlayer,
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-your-component',
  templateUrl: './your-component.component.html',
})
export class YourComponent {
  outletType: OutletTypes; // This would be set based on your application logic
  outletInfo: any; // This should be your actual data structure

  constructor() {
    // Initialize your outletType and outletInfo here or from an API call
    this.outletType = OutletTypes.Workitem; // Example value
    this.outletInfo = {}; // Fill with actual information
  }
}
```

### Summary

Using `ngSwitch` allows for easy conditional rendering of components in Angular based on a specific property, keeping your templates organized and readable.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":5448,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3729,""usageInWh"":1.6935}","321f9b39-b25b-40d5-847b-7bd65345848b","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-25T13:23:02.6635878Z","rdhqALeKrF7xAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7xAAAAAAAAAA==/","""51010b5e-0000-1600-0000-685bf8500000""","attachments/","1750857808"

This will allow you to check if `outletType` matches any of the values defined in your `outletTypes`.

### Using `*ngIf` with OR Condition

Here's how to implement that. Assuming you want to check if `currentOutletType` matches any of your defined `outletTypes`, you can do it like this:

```html
<ng-container *ngIf=""
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.Workitem || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.File || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.Meeting || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.User || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.Team || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.TimeRecord || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.Calendar || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.UserRessources || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.DataObject || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.Appointment || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.TimeRecordPlayer
"">
    <app-work-item *ngIf=""currentOutletType === outletTypes.Workitem"" [workItemInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-work-item>
    <app-file *ngIf=""currentOutletType === outletTypes.File"" [fileInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-file>
    <app-meeting *ngIf=""currentOutletType === outletTypes.Meeting"" [meetingInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-meeting>
    <app-user *ngIf=""currentOutletType === outletTypes.User"" [userInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-user>
    <app-team *ngIf=""currentOutletType === outletTypes.Team"" [teamInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-team>
    <app-time-record *ngIf=""currentOutletType === outletTypes.TimeRecord""></app-time-record>
    <app-calendar *ngIf=""currentOutletType === outletTypes.Calendar"" [calendarInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-calendar>
    <app-user-resources *ngIf=""currentOutletType === outletTypes.UserRessources"" [outletInfo]=""outletInfo"" [isDoubleClickEnabled]=""true""></app-user-resources>
    <app-data-object *ngIf=""currentOutletType === outletTypes.DataObject"" [dataObjectInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-data-object>
    <app-appointment *ngIf=""currentOutletType === outletTypes.Appointment"" [appointmentInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-appointment>
    <app-time-record-player *ngIf=""currentOutletType === outletTypes.TimeRecordPlayer"" [playerInfo]=""outletInfo""></app-time-record-player>
</ng-container>

<ng-container *ngIf=""!( 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.Workitem || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.File || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.Meeting || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.User || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.Team || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.TimeRecord || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.Calendar || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.UserRessources || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.DataObject || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.Appointment || 
    currentOutletType === outletTypes.TimeRecordPlayer
)"">
    <p>No valid outlet type selected.</p>
</ng-container>
```

### Explanation

1. **Using `*ngIf` with Logical OR**:
   - The `*ngIf` directive evaluates if `currentOutletType` matches any of the outlet types. If any condition is true, the container contents will be displayed.
  
2. **Component Rendering**:
   - Inside the `<ng-container>`, individual components are conditionally rendered by checking if `currentOutletType` matches the corresponding outlet type using additional `*ngIf` directives.

3. **Fallback Message**:
   - The second `<ng-container>` checks the opposite condition. If none of the outlet types match, it displays a fallback message indicating that no valid outlet type is selected.

### Summary

This approach allows you to treat the presence of multiple options as a single ""true"" condition using an OR (`||`) operator. By combining `*ngIf` in this way, you maintain clear control over what gets rendered based on the current state of `currentOutletType`.","{""numberOfInputTokens"":5544,""numberOfOutputTokens"":3944,""usageInWh"":1.7676}","884bc2ae-0ce4-4686-b526-ce258922fa7f","9250399f97714bbc9cf82b2e39c83b3a","2025-06-25T13:23:59.5189629Z","rdhqALeKrF7yAAAAAAAAAA==","dbs/rdhqAA==/colls/rdhqALeKrF4=/docs/rdhqALeKrF7yAAAAAAAAAA==/","""51017067-0000-1600-0000-685bf89e0000""","attachments/","1750857886"

Gibt es da passende Apps?","0","gpt-4.1-nano","2","true","2025-06-25T15:44:02.771118Z","Um auf deiner Wix-Website ein Banner mit den drei nächsten Ereignissen aus deinem Google Kalender anzuzeigen, gibt es mehrere Möglichkeiten. Hier sind die besten Ansätze inklusive passender Apps und Lösungen:

### 1. **Verwendung einer spezialisierten App für Kalender-Feeds**

#### a) **Wix App „Google Calendar“ oder „Embed Calendars“**
- **Beschreibung:** Diese Apps integrieren den Google Kalender direkt auf deiner Seite, aber oft sind sie eher für die vollständige Kalenderansicht gedacht.
- **Limitierung:** Für ein Banner mit nur den nächsten drei Ereignissen ist diese Lösung meist zu umfangreich.

#### b) **Apps zur Event- oder Kalenderanzeige mit Feed-Filterung**
- Es gibt spezielle Wix-Apps wie:
  - **Wix Events** (für eigene Events, nicht direkt Google Kalender)
  - **powr.io Apps** (z.B. „Powr Calendar“ oder „Powr Inc“)
  - **Elfsight Widgets** – **Event Calendar Widget** oder Ähnliches
  
**Elfsight** bietet z.B. ein **„Upcoming Events“** Widget, das mit Google Kalender verbunden werden kann, um die nächsten Termine anzuzeigen. Diese Widgets sind sehr flexibel und lassen sich optisch anpassen.

### 2. **Verbindung von Google Kalender zu einem Drittanbieter-Widget (z.B. Elfsight, Widgetbox)**

- **Vorteil:** Diese Dienste lassen sich mit deinem Google Kalender verbinden, dann kannst du die letzten kommenden Termine in einem ansprechenden Banner anzeigen.
- **Beispiel:**  
  - **Elfsight „Upcoming Events“ Widget**  
  - **Funktion:** Zeigt die nächsten Ereignisse an, kannst es individuell gestalten, und es ist mit Google Kalender kompatibel.

**So funktioniert es:**  
- Erstelle das Widget bei Elfsight oder einem anderen Anbieter  
- Verbinde es mit deinem Google Kalender (über API/Anleitungen der App)  
- Integriere den generierten Code in deine Wix-Startseite via HTML-Embed-Element

### 3. **Manuelle Lösung mit automatisierten Skripten (fortgeschritten)**

- Wenn du technische Fähigkeiten hast, kannst du eine **Google Apps Script API** verwenden, um die nächsten drei Ereignisse abzurufen und in einem angepasst gestalteten Banner auf der Startseite anzuzeigen.
- Voraussetzung ist Programmierkenntnis, und du könntest z.B. eine **benutzerdefinierte API** bauen, die die Daten liefert, und in Wix über iFrame/HTML einbinden.

### 4. **Empfohlene Vorgehensweise:**

**Am einfachsten und ohne Programmieraufwand:**

- Nutze eine **Elfsight Events Widget** (kostenpflichtig, aber einfach in der Handhabung)
- Verbinde es mit deinem Google Kalender
- Platziere den Widget-Code im Banner auf der Startseite (über HTML-Frame)

### 5. **Design des Banners:**

- Erstelle im Wix-Editor eine **Box oder einen Bereich** oberhalb des „above the fold“ (also im sichtbaren Bereich beim Laden), z.B. mit Text „Nächste Veranstaltungen“ oder „Was ist als Nächstes?“
- Integriere das Widget direkt in den Bereich, so dass die drei kommenden Ereignisse prominent angezeigt werden.

### Zusammenfassung der besten Lösung:

| Lösung | Vorteile | Nachteile |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Elfsight Upcoming Events** | Einfach, optisch anpassbar, Google Kalender integrierbar | Kostenpflichtig, externe Plattform nötig |
| **Wix eigene Apps** | Einfach, direkt in Wix integrierbar | Mögliche Limitierungen bei nur 3 Ereignissen |
| **Eigene Programmierung (API)** | Vollste Kontrolle | Technisch aufwendig |

Hier ist eine grundlegende Vorgehensweise, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen:

### Beispiel: Automatisches Senden von Nachrichten in Teams basierend auf Excel-Daten

#### Voraussetzungen:
- Microsoft 365 Konto mit Zugriff auf Power Automate, Excel Online, und Teams.
- Excel-Datei in OneDrive oder SharePoint, die strukturiert ist (z.B. Spalten für Name, Nachricht, Empfänger, etc.).

---

### Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitung:

1. **Excel vorbereiten:**
   - Stelle sicher, dass deine Excel-Tabelle in OneDrive oder SharePoint gespeichert ist.
   - Die Tabelle sollte z.B. Spalten wie: `Empfänger`, `Nachricht`, `Datum` usw. enthalten.

2. **Power Automate Flow erstellen:**
   - Gehe zu Power Automate und erstelle einen neuen Flow, z.B. einen **geplanten Flow** (z.B. täglich oder wöchentlich), oder einen **automatischen Flow** bei Änderung der Excel-Tabelle.

3. **Excel Daten abrufen:**
   - Nutze die Aktion **""Excel Online (Business) – Zeilen abrufen""** (oder ""List rows present in a table""), um alle Zeilen deiner Tabelle zu holen.

4. **Für jede Zeile eine Schleife:**
   - Füge eine **""Anwendung für jede""**-Schleife hinzu, um durch alle Zeilen zu iterieren.

5. **Nachricht an Teams senden:**
   - Innerhalb der Schleife kannst du die Aktion **""Nachricht in einem Chat oder Kanal senden""** (Teams Connector) verwenden.
   - Wähle den Ziel-Kanal oder den Chat (falls du direkt an einzelne Personen schicken willst).
   - Verwende die Daten aus der Excel-Tabelle, z.B.:
     - Empfänger (z.B. Name oder Teams-Chat-ID)
     - Nachricht (aus der Excel-Spalte)

### Beispiel-Flow-Layout:
1. **Trigger:** Geplanter Trigger (z.B. täglich um 8 Uhr)
2. **Aktion:** Excel-Daten aus Tabelle lesen
3. **Aktion:** Für jede Zeile in den Excel-Daten
   - **Aktion:** Teams-Nachricht senden (an Kanal oder Benutzer)
     - Nachricht: dynamischer Text, z.B. ""Guten Tag, {Name}! Hier ist deine automatisierte Nachricht.""

---

### Hinweise:
- Um Nachrichten an einzelne Teammitglieder zu senden, kannst du deren Teams-IDs verwenden, oder den Kanal nutzen.
- Für das Senden an einzelne Personen kannst du auch **""Chat starten""** und dort eine Nachricht schicken, falls direktes Messaging erforderlich ist.
- Stelle sicher, dass deine Excel-Tabelle gut strukturiert ist und die Daten aktuell sind.

---

# Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitung: Automatisch Nachrichten in Teams basierend auf Excel-Daten senden

## 1. Voraussetzungen prüfen & vorbereiten
- **Excel-Datei:**
  - Speicherort: **OneDrive for Business** oder **SharePoint**
  - Format: Tabelle (`Table`) mit mindestens folgenden Spalten:
    - `Empfänger` (z.B. Name, E-Mail, Teams-Chat-ID)
    - `Nachricht` (Text, der gesendet werden soll)
    - **Optional:** `Datum` oder andere Filterkriterien
- **Power Automate:** Zugriff auf dein Microsoft 365-Konto

---

## 2. Excel-Tabelle erstellen
- Öffne Excel Online (oder Excel Desktop, dann in OneDrive/SharePoint speichern).
- Erstelle eine Tabelle mit klaren Spaltenüberschriften, z.B.:

| Empfänger       | Nachricht                                         | Datum      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------|
| user1@domain.com| Hallo, hier ist eine automatische Nachricht!    | 2023-10-20 |
| user2@domain.com| Bitte denke daran, deinen Bericht zu senden.    | 2023-10-20 |

- Speichere die Datei in OneDrive oder SharePoint, z.B. unter `/Dokumente/Nachrichten.xlsx`.

---

## 3. Power Automate Flow erstellen

### Schritt 1: Trigger wählen
- **Geplant:** Täglich, wöchentlich, oder alle X Stunden
  - *Trigger: ""Geplanter Cloud-Flow""*

### Schritt 2: Excel-Daten abrufen
- **Aktion:** ""Excel Online (Business) – Zeilen abrufen""
  - **Standort:** OneDrive oder SharePoint
  - **Datei:** Suche deine Excel-Datei
  - **Tabelle:** Wähle die Tabelle aus

### Schritt 3: Schleife durch alle Zeilen
- Füge eine **""Für jede""**-Aktion hinzu
- **Wert:** `Werte aus ""Zeilen abrufen""` (die List-Outputs)

### Schritt 4: Nachricht an Teams senden
Innerhalb der Schleife:

- **Aktion:** ""Teams – Chatnachricht senden"" oder ""Teams – Kanalnachricht posten""

   **Option 1: Nachricht an einen Kanal senden**

   - **Team:** Wähle dein Team
   - **Kanal:** Wähle den Kanal
   - **Nachricht:** Nutze dynamische Inhalte, z.B.:

     ```
     {Nachricht} (z.B. ""Guten Tag, hier ist eine Nachricht für {Empfänger}"")
     ```

   **Option 2: Personal Nachricht an einzelne Benutzer senden**

   - **Empfänger:** Nutze die `Empfänger` Spalte (z.B. E-Mail oder Teams-Chat-ID)
   - **Achtung:** Das direkte Senden an einzelne Personen erfordert, dass du die Teams-Chat-ID hast. Alternativ kannst du einen Chat starten und eine Nachricht schicken.

---

## 4. Optional: Empfänger dynamisch bestimmen

Wenn du z.B. per E-Mail-Adresse oder Namen arbeitest:

- Du kannst die E-Mail-Adresse in der Spalte `Empfänger` haben.
- Für direkte Nachrichten an einzelne Personen könntest du die **""Chat starten""**-Aktion verwenden, allerdings ist diese manchmal eingeschränkt.

Alternativ:
- Poste Nachrichten in einem Kanal und erwähne die Empfänger mittels `@`-Erwähnungen, falls passend.

---

## 5. Flow testen und anpassen

- Speichere den Flow.
- Führe einen Testlauf durch.
- Kontrolliere, ob die Nachrichten wie gewünscht in Teams erscheinen.

---

## **Zusatztipps:**

- **Mehrere Empfänger:** Wenn du Nachrichten an mehrere Personen schicken möchtest, kannst du eine Schleife um die Empfänger machen.
- **Nachricht an mehrere Kanäle:** Du kannst mehrere ""Kanalnachricht senden""-Aktionen hinzufügen.
- **Filtern:** Nutze Bedingungen, um nur bestimmte Zeilen zu verarbeiten (z.B. nach Datum oder Status).

---

## Zusammenfassung:
- Dein Flow liest Daten aus Excel.
- Für jede Zeile sendet er eine Teams-Nachricht.
- Nachrichten sind dynamisch und können individuell angepasst werden.

Lass uns Schritt 3 genauer betrachten, der das Verarbeiten jeder Zeile in deiner Excel-Datei beschreibt:

---

## Schritt 3: Schleife durch alle Zeilen

Nachdem du die Excel-Daten abgerufen hast, besteht der nächste Schritt darin, durch jede Zeile dieser Daten zu iterieren. Dies erreichst du durch die Einrichtung einer Schleife, die jede Zeile einzeln verarbeitet und basierend auf den Inhalten dieser Zeilen die entsprechenden Aktionen ausführt.

### So richtest du die Schleife ein:

1. **Aktion hinzufügen: ""Für jede""**
   - **Beschreibung:** Diese Aktion hilft dir dabei, durch jede Zeile (jeden Datensatz) in deinem abgerufenen Excel-Datenbestand zu iterieren.
   - **Wert:** Gib hier die Output-Variable aus der vorherigen Excel-Datenabfrage an. Zum Beispiel, falls du ""Zeilen abrufen"" als Aktion gewählt hast, wähle das Ergebnis dieser Aktion aus (oft bezeichnet als `value`).

2. **Innerhalb der ""Für jede""-Schleife:**
   - Hier kannst du die Informationen der aktuellen Zeile verwenden, um die nächste Aktion zu definieren. In diesem Fall möchtest du eine Nachricht in Teams senden, basierend auf den Daten in der jeweiligen Zeile (z.B. Spalten wie `Empfänger`, `Nachricht`, etc.).

----

Dank der ""Für jede"" Schleife wird gewährleistet, dass jede Zeile in deiner Excel-Tabelle berücksichtigt wird, was bedeutet, dass du individuell auf die Bedürfnisse und Nachrichten jedes Empfängers eingehen kannst, der in der Excel-Tabelle aufgeführt ist.

Du kannst einen Flow einrichten, der automatisch ausgelöst wird, sobald eine Excel-Datei an einem bestimmten Ort gespeichert wird. Dazu verwendest du einen Trigger, der auf neue Dateien in einem Ordner in OneDrive for Business oder SharePoint reagiert. Hier ist, wie du das einrichten kannst:

### Vorbereitungen:
- Stelle sicher, dass die Excel-Datei in einem überwachten Ordner in **OneDrive for Business** oder **SharePoint** gespeichert wird.
- Die erforderlichen Berechtigungen für Power Automate auf die entsprechenden Speicherorte (OneDrive/SharePoint).

---

### Schritt-für-Schritt Anleitung:

1. **Neuen Flow in Power Automate erstellen:**
   - Logge dich in Power Automate ein und klicke auf „Erstellen“.
   - Wähle „Automatisierten Cloud-Flow“ aus.

2. **Trigger auswählen:**
   - Suche nach dem Trigger „Wenn eine Datei erstellt wird“.
   - Wähle den entsprechenden Trigger basierend auf dem Speicherort:
      - **Für OneDrive for Business:** „OneDrive for Business - Wenn eine Datei erstellt wird“
      - **Für SharePoint:** „SharePoint - Wenn eine Datei in einem Ordner erstellt wird“

3. **Trigger konfigurieren:**
   - **Lage:** Wähle den Speicherort aus (OneDrive oder die SharePoint-Seite).
   - **Ordner:** Wähle den spezifischen Ordner aus, den du überwachen möchtest. Dieser Ordner ist der Ort, an dem du die Excel-Dateien speichern wirst, damit der Flow ausgelöst wird.

4. **Aktion festlegen:**
   - Nachdem der Trigger ausgelöst wird (wenn eine Datei im angegebenen Ordner erstellt wird), kannst du Aktionen hinzufügen, die auf die Datei zugreifen und mit ihr interagieren.
   - **Beispielaktion:** Falls du die Inhalte der Excel-Datei weiter verarbeiten möchtest, füge die Aktion „Excel Online (Business) - Tabelle abfragen“ hinzu, um die Tabellen in der Datei zu durchsuchen.

5. **Zusätzliche Logik:**
   - Du kannst Bedingungen oder weitere Schritte hinzufügen, um sicherzustellen, dass nur spezifische Dateien oder Daten in der Datei verarbeitet werden.
   - Hier könntest du z.B. überprüfen, ob es sich bei der Datei um die erwartete Datei handelt oder ob sie den richtigen Namen/das richtige Format hat.

6. **Flow testen:**
   - Speichere den Flow und lade eine Excel-Datei in den überwachten Ordner hoch, um den automatischen Ablauf zu testen.

---

### Zusammenfassung:
Dieser auslösende Flow beobachtet einen bestimmten Ordner und führt alle konfigurierten Aktionen automatisch aus, wenn eine neue Datei dort abgelegt wird. Dies ist perfekt, um Routineaufgaben zu automatisieren oder Daten sofort zu verarbeiten, sobald sie eingereicht werden.

Erinnerungen zu setzen, falls keine Antwort auf eine manuell gesendete E-Mail eingegangen ist. Jedoch benötigt dieser spezielle Anwendungsfall einige Überlegungen und Workarounds, da Power Automate standardmäßig nicht direkt die Überwachung von erhaltenen Antworten auf gesendete E-Mails unterstützt.

### Mögliche Lösung:

### Voraussetzungen:
- Zugriff auf Power Automate und Outlook (vorausgesetzt, du verwendest Outlook oder Office 365 für E-Mails).
- Ein Organisatorischer/digitaler Weg, um gesendete E-Mails zu verfolgen (z.B. mithilfe von Kategorien, Markierungen oder spezifischen Ordnern).

### Schritt-für-Schritt Anleitung:

1. **E-Mail-Tracking einrichten:**
   - Du kannst individuelle gesendete E-Mails in Outlook kategorisieren oder kennzeichnen. In diesem Beispiel könnten wir eine spezielle Kategorie wie „Erinnerung erforderlich“ verwenden.

2. **Power Automate Trigger einrichten:**
   - Erstelle einen **geplanten Cloud-Flow**, der regelmäßig (z.B. stündlich, täglich) prüft.

3. **Gesendete E-Mails abrufen:**
   - Füge eine Aktion hinzu: „Outlook-Mail - Abrufen von E-Mails“.
   - Filterkriterien: Suche nach E-Mails in deinem Gesendet-Ordner mit der Kategorie „Erinnerung erforderlich“ oder einer spezifischen Markierung.

4. **Überprüfung auf Antworten:**
   - Füge eine Aktion hinzu, um im Posteingang nach Antworten auf gesendete E-Mails zu suchen.
   - Dies kann anspruchsvoll sein, da Power Automate keinen nativen Support für das Tracking von Antworten auf individueller Basis bietet. Du könntest Kontrollkriterien wie „Ähnliche Betreffzeile“ oder „Antwort auf“ verwenden.
   - Möglicherweise müsstest du eine eigene Überwachungsliste führen (z.B. Excel-Tabelle oder SharePoint-Liste), die den Status von Antworten trackt.

5. **Erinnerung senden:**
   - Falls innerhalb eines bestimmten Zeitrahmens keine Antwort gefunden wird, sende dir eine automatische Erinnerungs-E-Mail.
   - Nutze die Aktion „E-Mail senden“ in Power Automate, um dich zu benachrichtigen, dass noch keine Antwort eingegangen ist.

---

### Bemerkungen:

- **Überwachung anpassen:** Möglicherweise ist es notwendig, deine manuell gesendeten E-Mails mit spezifischen Metadaten (zusätzliche Schlüsselwörter, Betreff-Annotationen) zu versehen, um effektive Überwachungen zu ermöglichen.
  
- **Externe Integration:** Je nach Bedarf könnten auch benutzerdefinierte Lösungen (z.B. kleine Datenbank für ein Systemmanagement oder Drittanbieter-Tools) nützlich sein, um den Status effizienter zu verfolgen.

Diese Lösung würde kontinuierliche Anpassung erfordern, da Power Automate für direktes Antwort-Tracking nicht konzipiert ist.

Du kannst aber bestimmte Workarounds und Strategien verwenden, um zumindest eine gewisse Nachverfolgung zu implementieren.

### Allgemeine Vorgehensweise:

1. **E-Mails über Power Automate senden:**
   - Verwende die Aktion **„Office 365 Outlook - E-Mail senden“**, um gezielt eine E-Mail zu verschicken. Du kannst dynamische Inhalte verwenden, um E-Mails individuell anzupassen.
   - Option: Füge eine eindeutige ID oder ein spezifisches Schlüsselwort in den Betreff oder in den E-Mail-Body ein, um diese Nachrichten leicht erkennen und verfolgen zu können.

2. **Überwachung von Antworten auf gesendete E-Mails:**
   - Trigger: **„Wenn eine neue E-Mail eintrifft“** im Posteingang verwenden.
   - Verwende Bedingungslogiken, um zu prüfen, ob eine neue eingehende E-Mail eine Antwort auf die gesendete E-Mail ist. Dies könnte über den Betreff (z.B. enthält „Re:“ oder das spezifische Schlüsselwort) oder über Konversationsthreads gemacht werden.
   - Da Power Automate E-Mails als separate Elemente sieht, wäre eine direkte Verknüpfung zu vorher gesendeten E-Mails kompliziert ohne zusätzliche Strukturen.

3. **Zusätzliches Tracking mit SharePoint oder Excel:**
   - Um Antworten effektiver zu überwachen, kannst du ein separates Tracking-System nutzen:
     - **Erstellung einer SharePoint-Liste** oder **Excel-Tabelle**, um die IDs oder Betreffzeilen zu speichern.
     - Aktualisierung des Status, wenn eine Antwort erkannt wird.
   - Aktualisiere den Status für jede gesendete E-Mail basierend auf dem Empfang einer entsprechenden Antwort.

4. **Benachrichtigung über nicht-erfolgte Antworten:**
   - Richte Erinnerungen an dich ein, falls innerhalb eines bestimmten Zeitraums keine Antwort vorliegt.
   - Verwende geplante Flows, um deine Tracking-Liste zu überwachen und sende per **„E-Mail senden“** eine Benachrichtigung, dass keine Antwort eingegangen ist.

### Zusammenfassung:
Du kannst Power Automate nutzen, um E-Mails zu versenden und das Eintreffen von Antworten zu überwachen, allerdings muss die Logik, die Antworten mit gesendeten E-Mails verknüpft, explizit von dir eingerichtet werden. Der Einsatz einer einzigartigen ID oder spezifischer Schlüsselwörter im Betreff der E-Mails kann helfen, die Nachverfolgung zu erleichtern.

### Wichtiges zur Google Kalender-Integration
- Google Kalender selbst unterstützt keine direkte Bild- oder ""Event-Bild""-Funktion.
- Das Elfsight Widget zeigt standardmäßig Event-Details wie Titel, Datum, Ort usw.
- Wenn du möchtest, dass deine Events auf deiner Website Bilder enthalten, gibt es zwei Hauptwege:

---

## 1. **Bilder in den Event-Beschreibungen in Google Kalender hinzufügen**

### So funktioniert es:
- Beim Erstellen oder Bearbeiten eines Events in Google Kalender kannst du die **Beschreibung** hinzufügen.
- **Füge dort eine Bild-URL** ein, z.B.:

```html
<img src=""https://deinewebsite.de/bilder/deinbild.jpg"" alt=""Eventbild"" width=""200"">
```

### Was passiert?
- Das ist nur wirksam, wenn das Elfsight Widget **HTML-injection** innerhalb der Event-Details unterstützt.
- Viele Widgets rufen nur die Standard-Infos ab und zeigen keine HTML- oder Bilder aus der Event-Beschreibung an.

### Fazit:
- Diese Methode ist **nicht immer zuverlässig**, da viele Kalender-Widgets nur Text und Termine anzeigen, keine HTML-Inhalte oder Bilder.

---

## 2. **Bilder direkt im Elfsight Widget konfigurieren oder anpassen**

Da Google Kalender nur Ereignistitel und -details übermittelt, kannst du im Elfsight Widget selbst **keine Bilder direkt hinzufügen** für jedes Event, das aus Google Kalender gezogen wird.

### Alternative Lösung:
- **Verwende eine individuelle Lösung**, bei der du für Events eigene Bilder im Widget-Design einstellst oder über eine separate Datenquelle (z.B. CSV, API).

---

## 3. **Praktische Empfehlung:**

### Einfachste Lösung:
- **Verwende den Elfsight Event Calendar ohne Bilder aus Google Kalender**, sondern erstelle eine **eigene zentrale Event-Liste** (z.B. in einem Google Sheet oder WordPress-Plugin), das Bilder enthält.
- **Importiere oder verbinde diese Daten** mit Elfsight, wenn möglich.

---

## Zusammenfassung:
- Google Kalender unterstützt kein direktes Bilder-Embedding bei Events.
- Das Elfsight Widget zeigt in der Regel nur Textinformationen an.
- Um **Event-Bilder** auf deiner Website sichtbar zu machen, kannst du:
  - Bilder in den Event-Beschreibungen in Google Kalender hinzufügen (nicht immer sichtbar im Widget)
  - Oder eine andere Datenquelle für Events mit Bildern nutzen (z.B. CSV-Import, API-Integration)
  - Oder das Design des Widgets anpassen, falls es die Funktion zulässt.

Allerdings hängt die Möglichkeit, HTML-Inhalte wie `<img>`-Tags in den Event-Beschreibungen anzuzeigen, stark von der Art der Integration ab.

**Wichtig:**  
- **Google Kalender** selbst unterstützt das Einfügen von HTML innerhalb der Event-Beschreibung **nicht direkt**. Was du dort eingibst, ist meistens reiner Text.  
- Das Elfsight Widget **kann nur die Textinformationen** (Titel, Datum, Beschreibung usw.) anzeigen, die es vom Kalender erhält.

### Speziell zum Support von HTML in Elfsight:
- **Elfsight Widget unterstützt keine Anzeige von HTML in den Event-Beschreibungen, die direkt aus Google Kalender gezogen werden.**  
- Falls du HTML in den Google Kalender-Beschreibungen einfügst (z.B. `<img src=...>`), wird das Widget **diese HTML-Elemente wahrscheinlich nicht korrekt rendern**, sondern nur als Text anzeigen.

### Fazit:  
- **Direktbilder (HTML-IMG-Tags) in Google Kalender-Beschreibungen werden vom Elfsight Event Calendar Widget in der Regel nicht unterstützt.**  
- Das Widget zeigt nur den Text.  
- Für Bilder in Events ist es notwendig, **entweder nur ein Bild-URL im Beschreibungstext anzugeben (als reiner Link)**, oder alternative Wege zu nutzen.

### Empfehlung:
Wenn du nur ein Bild-URL in der Beschreibung einfügst, z.B.  
`https://deinewebsite.de/bilder/deinbild.jpg`,  
wird dieses als reiner Text angezeigt, **nicht als Bild**.  

Um Bilder im Event-Display sichtbar zu machen, müsstest du auf andere Methoden zurückgreifen, z.B.:
- Verwendung eines **anderen Widgets oder Plugins**, das HTML rendering in Beschreibungen unterstützt,  
- oder eine **individuelle Lösung** mit einer Datenquelle, die Bilder direkt enthält.
